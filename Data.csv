These mobile technologies offer a number of potential benefits, including: (a) increased awareness and social acceptance of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), (b) greater consumer empowerment in accessing AAC solutions, (c) increased adoption of AAC technologies, (d) greater functionality and interconnectivity, and (e) greater diffusion of AAC research and development. However, there remain a number of significant challenges that must be addressed if these benefits are to be fully realized: (a) to ensure the focus is on communication, not just technology, (b) to develop innovative models of AAC service delivery to ensure successful outcomes, (c) to ensure ease of access for all individuals who require AAC, and, (d) to maximize AAC solutions to support a wide variety of communication functions. There is an urgent need for effective collaboration among key stakeholders to support research and development activities, and to ensure the successful implementation of mobile technologies to enhance communication outcomes for individuals who require AAC and their families. © 2013 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Acquired disabilities; Communication; Developmental disabilities; IPad; Mobile technology,"Acquired disabilities; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communication functions; Consumer empowerment; Developmental disability; IPad; Mobile Technology; Research and development; C (programming language); Communication; Hand held computers; Human rehabilitation engineering; Telecommunication equipment; communication aid; developmental disorder; editorial; human; microcomputer; mobile phone; communication aid; Developmental Disabilities; mobile phone; personal digital assistant; trends; Cellular Phone; Communication Aids for Disabled; Computers, Handheld; Developmental Disabilities; Humans; Cell Phones; Communication Aids for Disabled; Computers, Handheld; Developmental Disabilities; Humans",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878456694,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"iPad, Smartphone, Apps ","ALS, Aphasia, ASD, Cerebral Palsy, Motor Disabilities",n/a

Research in the area is currently underdeveloped with practitioners having a limited body of work on which to draw to guide the process of intervention. Concerns have been raised that this newly developed technology may have limited functional usage. Aims: This review aims to investigate the potential barriers and facilitators to high-technology AAC provision and its ongoing use. The aim of the analysis is to explore factors underpinning use rather than effectiveness, thus it synthesized data from predominantly qualitative and survey studies reporting the views and perceptions of AAC users or staff providing the devices. Main Contribution: The review highlights the range of factors that can impact on provision and use of high-technology AAC, which practitioners should consider and address as appropriate in the intervention process. These include: ease of use of the device; reliability; availability of technical support; voice/language of the device; decision-making process; time taken to generate a message; family perceptions and support; communication partner responses; service provision; and knowledge and skills of staff. The work outlines how qualitative synthesis review methods may be applied to the consideration of published material that is not reporting outcomes data, and how this may provide valuable information to inform future studies. Conclusions: Practitioners should be aware of barriers and facilitators to successful use when making recommendations, and consider how barriers where present might be overcome. Aspects of service delivery such as ongoing technical support and staff training may require further consideration. The synthesis of evidence describing views of users and providers, and the implementation of high-technology AAC systems, can provide valuable data to inform intervention studies and functional outcome measures. © 2011 Royal College of Speech & Language Therapists.",assistive technology; augmentative and alternative communication; systematic review,adult; attitude to health; caregiver; child; communication aid; decision making; health care delivery; health personnel attitude; human; review; utilization review; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Attitude to Health; Caregivers; Child; Communication Aids for Disabled; Decision Making; Health Services Accessibility; Humans,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857738116,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"DeltaTalker, Dynavox, Liberator with Unity, Pathfinder, AlphaSmart, LightWrighter, laptop, Pathfinder, Liberator, BigMak, Boardmaker, Intellikeys, SentenceShaper ",AAC users ,n/a

Typical of many severely physically impaired augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) clients, the childs lack of a reliable means of communication at the outset of intervention precluded insight into her true developmental status. Assessment was further confounded by the fact that English was the childs second language. AAC intervention was therefore initiated on the basis of minimal diagnostic input. Despite this fact, all AAC programming was conducted in a contexually relevant, highly interactive format using aided language stimulation techniques to foster frequent interactive symbolic use. Results of intervention were quite dramatic with both picture symbol communication and functional speech emerging. With the attainment of a reliable means of communication, professionals were eventually able to evaluate the childs true developmental status. A severely physically impaired child, initially believed to be mentally retarded, was ultimately determined to be of normal intelligence. © 1989, Informa UK Ltd.

Fundamentally, this refers to the relative effort that must be exerted (the cost) in order for AAC to be a viable communication mode (the magic). Many clinicians have seen the magic for clients who are truly successful in using AAC; such successes have also been documented in the literature. Yet until AAC is successful with each and every client for whom it is implemented, it is necessary to continue to identify barriers to its effective use. In the same year, Light and Lindsay (1991) argued for consideration of principles of cognitive science in constructing maximally useful AAC symbol arrays. In the current paper, we consider how knowledge from one area of cognitive science, that of visual cognition, might be integrated into AAC symbol array construction. We review four areas of visual cognition that might relate to the construction of AAC displays:(a) organization of stimulus arrays within either grids (row-column configuration) or integrated within natural scenes, (b) symbol location, (c) color and contrast, and (d) symmetry and axial orientation. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Cognitive science; Symbol organization; Visual processing,Color; Handicapped persons; Neurophysiology; Vision; Alternative communication; Augmentative communication; Cognitive science; Symbol organization; Visual cognitive neuroscience; Visual processing; Speech communication,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-4544229749,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,AAC users,n/a

Following acquisition, rates of requesting and vocalizations were compared across two conditions (speech output on versus speech output off) that were alternated on a session-by-session basis. There were no major or consistent differences across the two conditions for the three children, suggesting that access to preferred objects was the critical variable maintaining use of the SGDs. The results also suggest that feedback in the form of digitized speech from the SGD did not inhibit vocalizations.

In the present study, we evaluated the effectiveness of functional communication training as an intervention for the aggression, self-injury, and tantrums exhibited by three students. Assistive devices were used to augment their communicative skills. Following an assessment of the function of their challenging behavior, the students were taught to use their devices to request the objects and activities maintaining their behavior (e.g. social attention, breaks from work). Multiple baseline data collected across the three students indicated that not only did the students use their devices successfully, but the intervention also reduced their challenging behavior. In addition, data on how the students were affected showed that they displayed increased positive facial expression following the communication intervention compared with before training. These results are discussed in the context of recent efforts to develop effective interventions for severely challenging behavior for persons with limited communication skills. © 1993, Informa UK Ltd.

In order to truly harness the power of technology, rehabilitation and educational professionals must ensure that AAC intervention is driven, not by the devices, but rather by the communication needs of the individual.

A total of 80 typically developing children participated in the two studies: 40 four-year-olds (Study 1) and 40 five-year-olds (Study 2). Ten children in each study were randomly assigned to each of the four system organization conditions. The children were introduced to target vocabulary items (24 items for the 4-year-olds and 30 for the 5-year-olds) in a series of four learning and testing sessions. Half of the vocabulary items were concrete concepts and half were abstract concepts. Results of the studies indicated that the 4-year-old and 5-year-old children were more accurate locating target vocabulary in the three dynamic display conditions (taxonomic grid, schematic grid, schematic scene) than in the iconic encoding condition. On initial exposure to the systems, the iconic encoding technique was not at all transparent to the children; the other three systems were only moderately transparent. All but one of the 4-year-old children and all of the 5-year-old children demonstrated gains in accuracy across the learning sessions; gains were significantly greater for the three dynamic display conditions than for the iconic encoding condition. The children were more accurate with the concrete vocabulary items than the abstract ones. There was some, albeit limited, evidence that the children generalized to facilitate learning of novel vocabulary items. Results are discussed with reference to the literature.

Despite the increased availability of computer-based augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, their use with adults with aphasia is limited as few devices have been designed for this population. The TalksBac system was designed specifically for nonfluent adults with aphasia and was used by four nonfluent aphasic individuals for a period of 9 months. The TalksBac system is word-based and exploits the ability of some nonfluent individuals with aphasia to recognize familiar words and short sentences. The system consists of two programs. Personal sentences and stories are entered into the TalksBac database by use of a 'carer program'. The 'user program' assists the nonfluent aphasic user to retrieve these prestored conversational items by offering probable items based on previous use of the system. The database has a hierarchical structure, but the links to individual items adapt automatically to reflect usage by individual users over time. Four nonfluent adults with aphasia were selected to participate in the study. Each subject was assessed by use of a battery of tests to provide pre-intervention data about their comprehension, expression and communication skills. Subjects and their carers mere trained to use the TalksBac system and were involved in developing personalized databases. They were supported in use of the personalized systems for an intervention period of 9 months. At the end of this period, subjects' communication skills were reassessed by use of a battery of tests. Clients' conversational abilities with and without the TalksBac system were also compared to see if use of TalksBac did augment their conversation and allow die aphasic partner to participate more fully within conversations. This was done by analysing videotaped conversations between subjects and non-aphasic partners. Results from the formal assessments indicated that there was little change in the underlying comprehension and expressive abilities of the subjects. An analysis of videotaped conversations showed that 1 subject was unable to carry out conversations using TalksBac independently, so the data for this subject was not included in the results of the analysis of conversations. Results from the video analysis for the remaining three subjects indicated that when using the TalksBac system, the conversational abilities of two subjects improved. The conversational abilities of the other subject were not enhanced by using the system as he had developed his own nonverbal strategies which he found to be more effective. This study has shown that TalksBac has the potential to augment the communication abilities of nonfluent adults with aphasia, who have not been able to develop their own compensatory strategies. Work continues to improve the efficiency of the software and to develop techniques to facilitate the carers' ability to generate conversational information for the system.",Aphasia; Assistive technology; Augmentative and alternative communication; Computer,adult; aged; aphasia; article; biomedical technology assessment; case report; clinical trial; comprehension; computer program; computer system; conversation; data base; female; human; interpersonal communication; language ability; male; medical technology; training; videotape; word recognition; Aged; Aphasia; Communication Aids for Disabled; Equipment Design; Evaluation Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Microcomputers; Middle Aged,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031884432,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,TalksBac,Aphasia,3

Most aided AAC systems rely on a visual modality. When the medium for communication is visual, it seems likely that the effectiveness of intervention depends in part on the effectiveness and efficiency with which the information presented in the display can be perceived, identified, and extracted by communicators and their partners. Understanding of visual-cognitive processing that is, how a user attends, perceives, and makes sense of the visual information on the display therefore seems critical to designing effective aided AAC interventions. In this Forum Note, we discuss characteristics of one particular type of aided AAC display, that is, Visual Scene Displays (VSDs) as they may relate to user visual and cognitive processing. We consider three specific ways in which bodies of knowledge drawn from the visual cognitive sciences may be relevant to the composition of VSDs, with the understanding the direct research with children with complex communication needs is necessary to verify or refute our speculations. © 2012 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Aided AAC; Visual and cognitive sciences; Visual scene displays,"AAC systems; Aided AAC; Cognitive processing; Cognitive science; Complex communication needs; Intellectual disability; Visual information; Visual modalities; Visual scene; Communication; Handicapped persons; child; communication aid; computer program; education of intellectually disabled; female; human; language development; male; methodology; photography; preschool child; psychological aspect; psychology; review; vision; Child; Child, Preschool; Cognitive Science; Communication Aids for Disabled; Education of Intellectually Disabled; Female; Humans; Language Development; Male; Photography; Software Design; Visual Perception",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865966210,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,AAC users,n/a

It has been questioned, however, whether such savings translate into an enhanced communication rate due to the additional overhead (e.g., shifting of focus and repeated scanning of a prediction list) required in using such a system. Our hypothesis is that word prediction has high potential for enhancing AAC communication rate, but the amount is dependent in a complex way on the accuracy of the predictions. Due to significant user interface variations in AAC systems and the potential bias of prior word prediction experience on existing devices, this hypothesis is difficult to verify. We present a study of two different word prediction methods compared against letter-by-letter entry at simulated AAC communication rates. We find that word prediction systems can in fact speed communication rate (an advanced system gave a 58.6% improvement), and that a more accurate word prediction system can raise the communication rate higher than is explained by the additional accuracy of the system alone due to better utilization (93.6% utilization for advanced versus 78.2% for basic). © 2009 ACM.",Communication rate; User study; Word prediction,AAC systems; Advanced systems; Communication rate; High potential; Prediction quality; User interaction; User study; Word prediction; Communication; User interfaces; Forecasting,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953892340,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,Word prediction systems ,n/a ,33

In its earliest days AAC technology was directed at enabling interpersonal face-to-face interactions mainly for persons with physical impairment. Contemporary AAC access attempts to mirror the access needs of a broader population. Accordingly AAC access to today's mainstream technologies expands the focus from interpersonal communication to access of information and services over the expanding World Wide Web. With this expanded view comes a new range of challenges and opportunities. At the same time AAC has expanded its reach to include more people with a wider range of complex communication needs. © 2012 Copyright 2012 RESNA.,AAC; access technology; assistive technology; augmentative and alternative communication,Human rehabilitation equipment; Access technology; Assistive technology; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Complex communication needs; Face-to-face interaction; Inter-personal communications; Physical impairments; Human rehabilitation engineering; article; communication aid; computer network; health care delivery; human; Communication Aids for Disabled; Computer Communication Networks; Health Services Accessibility; Humans,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859183674,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,AAC users ,n/a

The design process and the inventions were analyzed using qualitative methods. Results showed that the children's inventions differed significantly from the designs of current AAC technologies. Their inventions were not simply speech prostheses; rather, they integrated multiple functions (e.g., communication, social interaction, companionship, play, artistic expression, telecommunications) and provided dynamic contexts to support social interactions with others, especially peers. The children characterized the systems as companions and utilized innovative names, bright colors, lights, transformable shapes, popular themes, humor, and amazing accomplishments to capture interest, enhance appeal, build self-esteem, and establish a positive social image.

The two main findings were (a) that AAC was regularly used by speakers with dysarthria to attempt self-repairs of communication problems identified by their non-dysarthric partners; and (b) that AAC turns during self-repair activities were typically treated as intelligible but not fully understandable.

Many authors stress the heterogeneity of the aphasic population, not only in the characteristics of the aphasia, but also in communicative abilities and needs, cognitive abilities, motivation, and social situation. Therefore, AAC devices should be individualised and ""tailor-made"", taking advantage of residual language skills and communicative strengths. A common problem is that acquired AAC skills are often not used in daily communication. Several factors may play a role, e.g., lack of motivation, inadequate vocabulary, insufficient training, or cognitive or linguistic limitations. So far, functional use of assistive technology has received relatively little attention, but a portable device with ready-made messages for specific communicative situations appeared to be used in every day life. Conclusions: Computer technology has much to offer for supporting aphasic communication, not only for people with a very severe aphasia, who do not benefit from disorder-oriented therapy, but also for people with a moderate or mild aphasia. Research into AAC and aphasia, focusing on functional use, is needed in order to build and refine communication aids that are easy to use and can be tailored individually. © 2004 Psychology Press Ltd.",,aphasia; cognition; computer assisted therapy; daily life activity; disease severity; doctor patient relation; human; language ability; linguistics; motivation; population research; retrospective study; review; social life; speech therapy; technology; verbal communication; writing,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-2342586054,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,Aphasia,n/a

The study described here explores the perspectives of adults who use augmentative and alternative communication in relation to their use of aided communication. The aims were to describe the supports available to adults using aided communication, their views on the role(s) they assigned to aided communication within their total communication systems and the factors they identified as affecting their use of aided communication. Method. Eighteen adults with cerebral palsy who use aided communication were surveyed using questionnaire-based interviews exploring the range of services available to them and the relevance, importance and meaning they assigned to communication devices. Results. Overall, participants expressed positive views about aided communication. Although all identified many unaided modes of communication as being important, most participants ranked aided communication among their primary modes. Use of aided communication was reported to be influenced by communication partners, but also by device features, with major concerns about reliability emerging. Conclusions. Factors affecting the integration of aided communication are complex. For many adults, lack of key supports, including availability of communication partners restrict the contexts and extent to which aided communication is used. The comments from the participants highlight the need to develop services for adults who use aided communication. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",adult perspectives; Aided communication use,adult; article; attitude to computers; cerebral palsy; communication aid; female; human; interpersonal communication; male; perception; questionnaire; Adult; Attitude to Computers; Cerebral Palsy; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Female; Humans; Male; Questionnaires; Social Perception,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-62349108497,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"DeltaTalker, Lightwriter, DynaVox, Alphatalker, Pathfinder, BigMak","Cerebral Palsy, Degenerative Disabilities  ",24

Although aided AAC systems offer some advantages over speech, they also impose some unique demands, especially on working memory, which is commonly defined as the cognitive system by which individuals maintain and manipulate information while completing tasks. For instance, the presence of an external aided AAC device containing arrays of symbols, not all of which are visible simultaneously, presents multiple working memory demands: individuals must maintain the target concepts in mind, all the while (a) navigating through multiple pages, (b) remembering the appropriate or most efficient navigation path, (c) locating the target symbols within the array once the host page has been located, and (d) inhibiting responses to potentially interesting distracters throughout the process. Each of these task demands involves one or more working memory operations that have been identified and studied extensively in research in the cognitive sciences. Failure to acknowledge or understand how working memory might interact with AAC use may place unintentional barriers to effective AAC interventions. This paper explores current information about working memory operations and highlights some of the most relevant issues that warrant further direct study. © 2013 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Aided augmentative and alternative communication; Cognitive demands; Intellectual impairment; Working memory,"Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Cognitive demands; Cognitive science; Developmental disability; Intellectual impairment; Navigation paths; Target concept; Working memory; Cognitive systems; Speech communication; Human rehabilitation engineering; child psychology; cognition; communication aid; Developmental Disabilities; human; interpersonal communication; pathophysiology; phonetics; physiology; psychological model; psychology; short term memory; speech perception; vision; article; developmental disorder; psychological aspect; psychology; short term memory; Cognition; Cognitive Science; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Developmental Disabilities; Humans; Memory, Short-Term; Models, Psychological; Phonetics; Psychology, Child; Speech Perception; Visual Perception; Child Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive Science; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Developmental Disabilities; Humans; Memory, Short-Term; Models, Psychological; Phonetics; Speech Perception; Visual Perception",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882996260,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,IDD,n/a

Eye-gaze transfer (e-tran) boards, a low-tech alternative, are challenging to master and offer slow communication rates. To mitigate the drawbacks of these two status quo approaches, we created GazeSpeak, an eye gesture communication system that runs on a smartphone, and is designed to be low-cost, robust, portable, and easy-to-learn, with a higher communication bandwidth than an e-tran board. GazeSpeak can interpret eye gestures in real time, decode these gestures into predicted utterances, and facilitate communication, with different user interfaces for speakers and interpreters. Our evaluations demonstrate that GazeSpeak is robust, has good user satisfaction, and provides a speed improvement with respect to an e-tran board; we also identify avenues for further improvement to low-cost, low-effort gaze-based communication technologies. © 2017 ACM.",Accessibility; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); Eye gesture,Eye movements; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Human rehabilitation engineering; Smartphones; User interfaces; Accessibility; Amyotrophic lateral scleroses (ALS); Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communication bandwidth; Communication rate; Communication technologies; Eye-gestures; Motor impairments; Eye tracking,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044857637,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,GazeSpeak,ALS,27

The subject was a preschool girl with Down syndrome who had failed to demonstrate functional speech skills, despite evidencing symbolic play and comprehension skills at a 2-year level. The intervention incorporated the use of a scripted-play approach in which the subject and researcher cocreated scripts around two sets of props. The combined use of signs and the electronic device was found to be more effective than sign alone in eliciting single-word productions. In addition, the subject demonstrated two- and three-word combinations, which were more likely to be produced using the electronic device than in sign. An overall preference for the electronic device was evident for both spontaneous/responsive and imitated productions. The results support past research that has found augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to be effective in facilitating early language skills in children with Down syndrome. In addition, the findings contribute to evidence that signs may not be as facilitative of language production beyond the single-word level as are aided AAC techniques. Finally, the use of cocreated scripts was shown to allow for a child-directed approach in early language intervention incorporating AAC. © 1995, Informa UK Ltd.

Results were reviewed in terms of three study groupings: (a) studies that evaluated the effectiveness of treatment packages involving speech output, (b) studies comparing one treatment package with speech output to other AAC modalities, and (c) studies comparing the presence with the absence of speech output. The state of the evidence base is discussed and several directions for future research are posited. © 2015 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Assistive technology; Augmentative and alternative communication; Autism spectrum disorders; Mobile technologies; Scoping review; Speech output technology; Speech-generating devices; Synthetic speech,Diseases; Human rehabilitation engineering; Speech communication; Speech synthesis; Telecommunication equipment; Assistive technology; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Autism spectrum disorders; Mobile Technology; Scoping review; Speech generating devices; Speech output; Synthetic speech; Speech; Autism Spectrum Disorder; communication aid; human; speech; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Communication Aids for Disabled; Humans; Speech,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946017176,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,Autism,n/a

Unfortunately, it is difficult for young children to learn to scan because the design of current scanning techniques does not always make explicit the offer of items from the selection array; furthermore, it does not provide explicit feedback after activation of the switch to select the target item. In the current study, scanning was redesigned to reduce learning demands by making both the offer of items and the feedback upon selection more explicit through the use of animation realized through HTML and speech output with appropriate intonation. Twenty typically developing 2-year-olds without disabilities were randomly assigned to use either traditional scanning or enhanced scanning to select target items from an array of three items. The 2-year-olds did not learn to use traditional scanning across three sessions. Their performance in Session 3 did not differ from that in Session 1; they did not exceed chance levels of accuracy in either session (mean accuracy of 20% for Sessions 1 and 3). In contrast, the children in the enhanced scanning condition demonstrated improvements in accuracy across the three 10-20-min sessions (mean accuracies of 22 and 48% for Sessions 1 and 3, respectively). There were no reliable differences between the children's performances with the two scanning techniques for Session 1; however, by Session 3, the children were more than twice as accurate using the enhanced scanning technique compared to the traditional design. Results suggest that by redesigning scanning, we may be able to reduce some of the learning demands and thereby reduce some of the instructional time required for children to attain mastery.

Based on the sampling of the orientation of the individual's eyes, researchers can quantify which locations within the visual image were fixated (viewed), for how long, and how many times. These automated eye tracking research technologies open up a wealth of avenues for investigating how individuals with developmental or acquired communication disabilities may respond to aided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. In this paper, we introduce basic terminology and explore some of the special challenges of conducting eye tracking research with populations with disabilities who might use AAC, including challenges of inferring attention from the presence of fixation and challenges related to calibration that may result from participant characteristics, behavioral idiosyncracies, and/or the number of calibration points. We also examine how the technology can be applied to ask well-structured experimental questions that have direct clinical relevance, with a focus on the unique contributions that eye tracking research can provide by (a) allowing evaluation of skills in individuals who are difficult to assess via traditional methods, and (b) facilitating access to information on underlying visual cognitive processes that is not accessible via traditional behavioral measures. © 2014 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",AAC; Acquired disabilities; Developmental disabilities; Eye tracking; Overview; Research,"Calibration; Human rehabilitation engineering; Research; Technology; AAC; Acquired disabilities; Developmental disability; Eye-tracking; Overview; Tracking (position); attention; cognition; communication aid; Communication Disorders; Developmental Disabilities; eye fixation; eye movement; human; medical research; oculography; vision; Attention; Biomedical Research; Cognition; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Disorders; Developmental Disabilities; Eye Movement Measurements; Eye Movements; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Visual Perception",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902009238,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Eyetracking research ,AAC users,n/a

During the first phase of the treatment program, subjects were trained to identify single symbols and two-symbol combinations from different grammatical categories. The second phase involved training on production of simple subject-verb and subject-verb-object constructions using symbols correctly identified by subjects in the first phase. A single-subject, multiple-baseline design across behaviors replicated across five subjects was used to assess the effects of treatment on symbol identification. Results indicated that all subjects identified noun symbols with a greater degree of accuracy than symbols representing verb referents. Performance on symbol production task varied across subjects. The most frequently observed errors on the symbol production task were omission or incorrect selection of the symbols for the verb referents.

This is broadly known as “augmented input” and is thought to enhance the client’s learning of language form and content. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the effects of augmented input on communication outcomes in persons with developmental disabilities and persons with childhood apraxia of speech who use aided AAC. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Each included study was reviewed in terms of participant characteristics, terminology used, symbol format, augmented input characteristics, outcomes measured, effectiveness, and study quality. Results indicate that augmented input can improve single-word vocabulary skills and expression of multi-symbol utterances; however, comprehension beyond the single word level has not been explored. Additionally, it is difficult to form conclusions about the effect of augmented input on specific diagnostic populations.

Research has shown that perceptions of synthetic speech in individuals with intellectual and/or language impairments depend upon several general factors, including the acoustic-phonetic properties of the synthesizer, complexity of the perceptual task, and the experience of the listener. Additionally, individuals with intellectual and/or language impairments exhibit greater difficulties than nondisabled listeners with regard to processing synthetic speech signals that impose substantial cognitive demands.",Intellectual disability; Language impairments; Speech generation devices; Synthetic speech,Audition; Behavioral research; Speech analysis; Synthetic speech; Speech communication,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037650192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,AAC users,n/a

A comprehensive, quantitative, and accurate model for alternative access systems is needed to optimize both developers- design decisions and clinicians- system recommendations. This paper presents an application of one possible model, called the GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection Rules) model (Card, Moran, & Newell, 1983). The model provides a comprehensive description of user behavior based on system-specific parameters as well as the cognitive, perceptual, and motor capabilities of the user. It can be used to predict both task execution and learning times, as well as points of excessive long or short term memory load. The GOMS model is applied here to three interfaces currently used in AAC and computer access systems in order describe and predict user performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The three interfaces are: (a) row-column letter scanning; (b) row-column letter scanning combined with word prediction after the first two letter selections only; and (c) row-column letter scanning combined with word prediction after each letter selection. Techniques for applying the GOMS model are discussed, as well as the results predicted by the model. Results for the three systems modeled here suggest the possibility that word prediction interfaces, developed as a faster alternative to row-column letter scanning, may actually be less efficient than letter scanning. © 1990, Informa UK Ltd.

VSDs are based on the theory that language learning occurs through interactions with other people, and recommendations for VSD design have emphasized using images of these events that include humans. However, many VSDs also include other items that could potentially be distracting. We examined gaze fixation in 18 school-aged participants with and without severe intellectual/developmental disabilities (i.e., individuals with typical development, autism, Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities) while they viewed photographs with human figures of various sizes and locations in the image, appearing alongside other interesting, and potentially distracting items. In all groups, the human figures attracted attention rapidly (within 1.5 seconds). The proportions of each participant's own fixation time spent on the human figures were similar across all groups, as were the proportions of total fixations made to the human figures. Although the findings are preliminary, this initial evidence supports the inclusion of humans in VSD images. © 2014 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",AAC; Display design; Eye-tracking; Gaze patterns; Intellectual disability; Visual scene displays,Design; Diseases; Photography; AAC; Display designs; Eye-tracking; Gaze patterns; Intellectual disability; Visual scene; Visual languages,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902005523,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,Tobii T60,"Down Syndrome, Autism, IDD",18

This retrospective, exploratory study involved a file review of students with autism who participated in this initiative over a five-year period. The following questions were addressed. Who were the students with autism to whom technology was provided? What type(s) of technology did they receive? What were the profiles of students who received specific types of technology? For which educational goal areas was technology used? How successful was it? Results suggested that the majority of students received technology for educational participation while a smaller number received voice output communication aids; some students received both types of technology. The primary goals for which technology was used were related to writing, expressive communication, and social interaction. When numerical “success scores” were assigned to teachers' annual reports of the outcomes of technology use, 60% of the students were assigned scores suggesting successful or very successful use, and only 12% were scored as having little or no success. Success scores did not appear to be related to students' cognitive ability, but students who received technology at a young age appeared to experience more success than those who received it as adolescents.

Unfortunately, sign language is not understood by most of the common people. For this, a gadget based on image processing and pattern recognition can provide with a vital aid for detecting and translating sign language into a vocal language. This work presents a system for detecting and understanding the sign language gestures by a custom built software tool and later translating the gesture into a vocal language. For the purpose of recognizing a particular gesture, the system employs a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm and an off-the-shelf software tool is employed for vocal language generation. Microsoft® Kinect is the primary tool used to capture video stream of a user. The proposed method is capable of successfully detecting gestures stored in the dictionary with an accuracy of 91%. The proposed system has the ability to define and add custom made gestures. Based on an experiment in which 10 individuals with impairments used the system to communicate with 5 people with no disability, 87% agreed that the system was useful.

Among these, 61% were males and 39% were females. There has been a substantial increase in the use of AAC systems over the last 3 years and, indeed, over 50% of users have had their AAC systems no longer than 1 year. The AAC systems identified in this study were broadly divided into low-technology and high-technology systems. Although the data show a tremendous increase in the use of high-technology systems, the low-technology systems still accounted for more than 50% of all AAC systems used at present. There were a variety of methods of access both with low- and high-technology systems, indicating that a considerable proportion of users must rely on methods of access other than hand pointing. The majority of high-technology systems had voice output and all of the low-technology systems required listener interpretation (reading) of the message. It is important that, in addition to AAC systems, the users employed both their own idiosyncratic forms of nonverbal communication as well as other, more formalized, symbolic systems. Although the findings indicate that the great majority of users employed their AAC systems both in formal and informal situations, more investigations are necessary to establish why 22.2% of users employed their AAC systems only in formal (i.e. therapy and school) contexts. © 1995, Informa UK Ltd.

It showed that lexical prediction saves key/switch activation effort by as much as 50% compared to normal typing. For individuals with significant motor disabilities, the technique may also save on the time required to prepare a message. On the other hand, use by individuals who have significant perceptual deficits may result in an increase in the time required to prepare a message. The study also developed a procedure and a set of indices that may be used to compute quantitative measures of performance of assistive communication devices. The procedure yields a composite performance index that may be useful for rough and ready comparison among various AAC devices and techniques.

Automatic character disambiguation systems enable text to be typed upon a reduced keyboard with a keying efficiency approaching one key/character, despite the fact that each key represents more than one alphabetic character. Existing disambiguation systems typically use probabilistic models of character sequences (n-grams) from representative text samples to predict the next character, and hence disambiguate among the different characters on each key. N-grams for such disambiguation models have been extracted previously from large (1 million word) text corpora. The research reported here shows that a much smaller corpus of limited domain can be used with similar results, thus facilitating development of disambiguation systems by eliminating the need for a large corpus. Four reduced keyboard layouts are compared, three of which were used in earlier research on character disambiguation in the Dutch and English languages, and a fourth based on character frequency, which achieves similar efficiency to the first three. Models of different order are compared (the order of the model being determined by the length of the longest n-grams in it), the principal result being that, while higher-order models (containing long n-grams) give better performance than lower-order models (which contain only short n-grams), lower-order n-grams can contribute significantly to the disambiguation performance of a higher-order model, and should therefore be included in order to maximize disambiguation efficiency. © 1992, Informa UK Ltd.

When using VSDs with children with developmental disabilities or adults with acquired conditions, research supports the use of personalized photo VSDs that include familiar people engaged in meaningful activities, with navigation bars with thumbnail VSDs, located adjacent to the main VSD. Adults with acquired conditions seem to benefit from the inclusion of text boxes adjacent to the scene. Emerging evidence supports the use of motion to capture visual attention to VSDs (video VSDs) or to specific elements in VSDs. When using grid displays with children with developmental disabilities, research supports the use of spatial cues and clustering based on internal symbol colour to facilitate visual searching and selection. Background colour does not seem to facilitate searching for symbols on smaller displays, and may actually distract children from processing the meaningful components of symbols. Preliminary research suggests that the organization of onscreen keyboards and the number, types, and pairings of symbols in grids may impact performance of adults with acquired conditions.

Because vocabulary needs are difficult to predict, young children who use aided AAC often do not have access to vocabulary concepts as the need and interest arises in their daily interactions, limiting their vocabulary acquisition and use. Ideally, parents and professionals would be able to add vocabulary to AAC technologies ""just-in-time"" as required during daily interactions. This study compared the effects of two AAC applications for mobile technologies: GoTalk Now (which required more programming steps) and EasyVSD (which required fewer programming steps) on the number of visual scene displays (VSDs) and hotspots created in 10-min interactions between eight professionals and preschool-aged children with typical development. The results indicated that, although all of the professionals were able to create VSDs and add vocabulary during interactions with the children, they created more VSDs and hotspots with the app with fewer programming steps than with the one with more steps, and child engagement and programming participation levels were high with both apps, but higher levels for both variables were observed with the app with fewer programming steps than with the one with more steps. These results suggest that apps with fewer programming steps may reduce operational demands and better support professionals to (a) respond to the childs input, (b) use just-in-time programming during interactions, (c) provide access to more vocabulary, and (d) increase participation. © 2015 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Apps; augmentative and alternative communication; mobile technology; programming; visual scene displays,"Application programs; Human rehabilitation engineering; Just in time production; Mathematical programming; Telecommunication equipment; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Mobile Technology; Operational demands; Pre-school aged child; Typical development; Visual scene; Vocabulary acquisition; Young children; C (programming language); child; controlled study; human; human experiment; linguistics; adult; communication aid; comparative study; crossover procedure; female; male; middle aged; mobile application; preschool child; professional-patient relationship; software design; young adult; Adult; Child, Preschool; Communication Aids for Disabled; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Professional-Patient Relations; Software Design; Vocabulary; Young Adult",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957431230,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"GoTalk Now, Easy VSD ",Children,10

The results showed that a 15-word window produces significantly higher predictions and fewer keystrokes than a 5-word window. The time required to type the messages was statistically equivalent across windows. However, mean keystroke duration was significantly higher in the 15-word window as compared to the 5-word window. This study shows that (1) a saving in keystrokes does not necessarily result in an increase in the rate of communication in lexical prediction programs; (2) searching a word prediction window for target words places significant cognitive/perceptual demands on even individuals with presumably normal cognitive and perceptual abilities (and probably much more so on AAC users); and (3) a 15-word window produces roughly the same rate of communication as the 5-word window but at a significantly greater saving in effort (keystrokes/switch activations). © 1994, Informa UK Ltd.

This study investigated the impact of the provision of an iPad® 1 with an AAC app with visual scene displays and a dyadic turn taking training on the number of communicative turns taken by children with complex communication needs in interaction with same-age peers. Two preschool children with complex communication needs and six peers without disabilities participated in this research. A single-subject, multiple probe across partners design with one replication was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on the frequency of communicative turns expressed by the children with complex communication needs. Parents, teachers, speech-language pathologists, and the children participated in social validation measures. As a result of intervention, Participant 1 showed immediate gains in the frequency of symbolic communicative turns after the first training session across all three partners (average gains of 30–46 symbolic communicative turns per 10-min session across peer partners). Participant 2 showed some initial gains, but they were not maintained over time (average gains of 11–24 turns across partners).

The speech samples represented 2 to 2.5 hours of preschool and home activity for each child. Overall, the 10 children referred predominantly to the here and now and to themselves. The children appeared to reference past and future less frequently and fantasy more frequently at school than at home. Parents and siblings were referenced infrequently at school, while teachers were referenced infrequently at home. The most common and frequent semantic referents at home and at school were similar and referred to objects (toys and food), events (actions, play, projects), and ideas about people's traits or conditions.

Uptake of aided AAC was low; only 0.8 of participants used aided AAC as their primary means of expression. Valid interview responding was higher in turn for participants communicating with natural speech, aided AAC, and other modes. Almost half the participants were lonely, but loneliness did not differ by communication mode used; social contact and social climate variables predicted loneliness. Individuals who used aided AAC communicated more effectively than users of other non-speech modes, supporting more widespread use of aided AAC.

Initially, designers critically reflect on their own assumptions about how a design may affect social and individual behavior. Then, designers use these assumptions as stimuli to elicit other people's points of view. This process of critical self-reflection and evaluation helps the designer to assess the fit between a design and its intended social context of use. To demonstrate the utility of HCI-Q for research and design, we use HCI-Q to explore stakeholders' responses to a prototype Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) application called Vid2Speech. We show that our adaptation of Q-methodology is useful for revealing the structure of consensus and conflict among stakeholder perspectives, helping to situate design within the context of relevant value tensions and norms.

The augmentative and alternative communication field could benefit from existing research that has examined the development of memory strategy use in young children. Memory strategies differ in terms of their functional properties, such as automaticity, reliance on symbolic mediators, and overall complexity. Developmental constraints are reflected in predictable performance errors. Adults can help children become insightful about when, how, and why to apply a memory strategy.

Most persons with ALS experience a dysarthria that eventually renders oral/vocal communication unintelligible. This article reviews the communication needs of persons with ALS and the range of communication strategies used, including most forms of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). Survey data are presented concerning perceived presence and severity of communication deficits, common communication topics, and communication strategies used with different communication partners and at 3 time intervals (2-6 months, 4 weeks, and 1-2 days) before death. Survey data were collected from 625 family members/caregivers in 8 states in the United States, reporting on their experiences with persons with ALS who were deceased at the time of the survey. The analysis focused on patterns of communication used in the last 6 months as end-of-life approaches. Most common communication topics were physical needs, caregiving issues, and family issues. Least common topics were spiritual and death and dying issues. Communication strategies did change as end of life approached, with a decrease in all modes of communication including natural speech, writing, gestures, and electronic AAC. Unaided and low-tech strategies did not increase during the same time interval. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about the communication options available and factors influencing communication choices.

In recent years, rapid developments in technology have resulted in an explosion of devices available commercially, yet little research has been conducted into what people who use VOCAs think about them. Aims The aim of this research was to explore the perceptions of communication aid design from the perspective of end users and AAC professionals, with the objective being to inform and influence the design of future devices. Methods & Procedures A two-part study was conducted: interviews were undertaken with people who use VOCAs, and questionnaires were distributed to those who use aided communication and to AAC professionals. Analysis of the interview data was carried out using a qualitative method based on framework analysis, whilst descriptive statistics were generated from the questionnaire data. Interview participants were an opportunity sample of VOCA users within a defined region of the UK. Those recruited were over the age of 12 years and able to engage in the interview process; they were identified through the caseloads of local Speech and Language Therapists specializing in AAC. The questionnaire was marketed to the AAC community throughout the UK. Respondents were self-selecting as those using aided communication, their carers and AAC professionals. Outcomes & Results Eighteen people participated in the interviews. Questionnaires were completed by 43 people who use aided communication and 68 AAC professionals. The data suggest that current devices are considered to be neither reliable nor durable by users and professionals. Although features given a higher importance ranking are more likely to be perceived as available, a number of important design deficits are identified by users and/or professionals. Simplicity of design (and use) and the desire for devices which support communication that is as fast and spontaneous as possible also emerge as key requirements. Synthesis of the data produced a framework with three main themes covering the range of issues which influence the successful use of a VOCA: specific aspects of the design of a device; the consideration of the wider picture around the person; and the personal context in which someone uses their device. Conclusions & Implications Although the original aim of the project was to establish the user requirements of VOCA design, the data indicate that the characteristics of the device cannot be considered in isolation. Those factors uncovered highlight questions about whether the design of communication aids is truly effective in meeting the needs of the people who use them. Based on these data, an initial specification for future device design is proposed. © 2013 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.",augmentative and alternative communication; user-centred design; voice output communication aids,adolescent; adult; aged; attitude to computers; child; communication aid; computer interface; disabled person; equipment design; human; interpersonal communication; interview; middle aged; perception; psychology; questionnaire; voice; young adult; article; augmentative and alternative communication; communication aid; disabled person; psychological aspect; user-centred design; voice output communication aids; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude to Computers; Child; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Disabled Persons; Equipment Design; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Middle Aged; Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; User-Computer Interface; Voice; Young Adult; augmentative and alternative communication; user-centred design; voice output communication aids; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude to Computers; Child; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Disabled Persons; Equipment Design; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Middle Aged; Perception; Questionnaires; User-Computer Interface; Voice; Young Adult,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880773892,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,"Lightwriter, Pathfinder, Vantage, Say-It-Sam, Powerbox 3, Liberator ",AAC users,18 interviews and 111 survey responses

In the present study, we investigated whether two boys with significant intellectual disabilities would show a preference for using one of three AAC devices. Initially, the boys were taught to use three AAC devices (i.e., Cyrano Communicator™, Mini-MessageMate™, and a Picture Communication Board) using a multiple-probe-across-devices design. One participant was successful with only one device, while the other was successful in acquiring basic use of all three devices (i.e., making a request using the device and demonstrating correspondence between the picture icon and item requested). The child who acquired basic use of all three devices participated in the second phase. A choice assessment was conducted using a free-operant paradigm to determine which of the three devices he preferred. In the final phase, the most preferred device was targeted for more specific instruction (i.e., retrieving the device from a distance, turning the device on, approaching a communication partner, getting the communication partner's attention, and using the device to make a request), using a changing criterion design. Results for this participant indicated that he had a clear preference for one device and was able to learn how to use it in a more functional manner. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. © 2009 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",AAC intervention; Intervention; Preference; Significant intellectual disability,AAC intervention; Augmentative and alternative communication devices; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Clinical decision; Communication board; Communication partners; Intellectual disability; Intervention; Preference; Second phase; Significant intellectual disability; Specific instruction; Communication; Human rehabilitation engineering; adolescent; article; case report; child; communication aid; decision making; human; human relation; learning; male; mental deficiency; observer variation; patient attitude; psychological aspect; time; Adolescent; Child; Choice Behavior; Communication Aids for Disabled; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Learning; Male; Mental Retardation; Observer Variation; Patient Preference; Practice (Psychology); Time Factors,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449568719,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,"Cyrano Communicator, Mini-MessageMate ",IDD,2

An evaluative case study was performed to compare the new device to an existing commercially available voice-activated switch in terms of sensitivity, specificity, speed, and user fatigue. Method. The participant wrote pangram sentences with the two switches over 4 days with two sessions each day (morning and afternoon). The order of the switches was alternated and a new sentence was used each day. The user's perceived level of exertion was noted before and after each task and activation errors were logged for performance analysis. After using the device for 2 months, a qualitative survey was administered with the participant and his educational assistant. Results. The vocal cord vibration switch outperformed the voice-activated switch in terms of sensitivity (p &lt; 10−4, t-test), speed (p &lt; 10−3), and user-perceived exertion (p &lt; 10−4). Qualitatively, both the participant and his educational assistant were more satisfied with the proposed switch relative to his existing solution. Conclusions. The results of this study show that the vocal cord vibration switch provides a promising new alternative for individuals with severe and multiple disabilities who are able to hum or produce vocalizations. © 2010, Informa UK Ltd.

In the first study, the model structure represented performance as a linear combination of two user parameters, keypress and list search time. Two types of simulations were performed using this structure: Model 1A, in which user parameter values were determined independently, and Model 1B, which used parameter values derived from subjects' data. Model simulations of overall session performance, word entry times, and item selection times were compared to actual performance of able-bodied and spinal cord injured subjects transcribing text with and without word prediction over the course of seven test sessions. The average errors for Models 1A and 16 in modeling subjects' word entry times were 27% and 16%, respectively. The second study used a revised model for list search time in an attempt to improve model accuracy and increase understanding of the list search process. The model revision led to only a small improvement in accuracy but did provide insight into how list search time depends on the context of the search. The results point out the need to understand a user's characteristics before applying a model, but they are an encouraging demonstration of the ability of analytical models to represent user performance with word prediction.",Augmentative communication; Group designs; Rate enhancement; User modeling; Word prediction,Computer simulation; Data structures; Mathematical models; Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); Keystrokes level models; Computer aided instruction,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031352912,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,n/a ,Spinal Cord Injury ,14

To date, there has been a notable lack of basic research in the AAC field to investigate the underlying cognitive, sensory perceptual, linguistic, and motor processes of individuals with complex communication needs. Eye tracking research technology provides a promising method for researchers to investigate some of the visual cognitive processes that underlie interaction via AAC. The eye tracking research technology automatically records the latency, duration, and sequence of visual fixations, providing key information on what elements attract the individual's attention (and which ones do not), for how long, and in what sequence. As illustrated by the papers in this special issue, this information can be used to improve the design of AAC systems, assessments, and interventions to better meet the needs of individuals with developmental and acquired disabilities who require AAC (e.g., individuals with autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities of unknown origin, aphasia). © 2014 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Applied research; Basic research; Complex communication needs; Eye tracking,Communication; Eye movements; Human rehabilitation engineering; Tracking (position); Applied research; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Autism spectrum disorders; Communication process; Complex communication needs; Eye-tracking; Intellectual disability; Research technologies; Engineering research,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901984870,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,AAC users,n/a

The use of augmented input through visual modalities might be an effective means for supplementing spoken language. The purpose of this preliminary study was to compare spoken input with two augmented input modalities (i.e., speech + visual cues) in terms of children's ability to follow directives involving prepositions. The augmented input modalities consisted of static scene cues (i.e., photographic or pictorial visual scenes that portray relevant concepts and their relationships) and dynamic scene cues (i.e., full-motion video clips that depict the actions underlying relevant concepts and their relationships). A within-subjects design involving nine children with autism or pervasive developmental disorders-not otherwise specified was used to examine the effectiveness of the three input conditions. Results indicated that both static scene cues and dynamic scene cues were more effective than spoken cues, but there were no differences between static scene cues and dynamic scene cues. Results are discussed in terms of appropriate instructional inputs for children with autism.

Six participants (ages 19 to 35) with physical disabilities and intelligible speech were interviewed about their experiences using their speech recognition software. Using this software on their home computers, the participants completed five dictation tasks. Average individual dictation speeds ranged from 9 to 15 words per minute and average recognition accuracy ranged from 62 to 84%. The use of formatting and correction commands resulted in an average of two utterances being required to generate each dictation word. Participants found that recognition accuracy was not acceptable and that their speech recognition software was appropriate for use with word processors but had limited use with other applications. This study found that discrete utterance speech recognition can be effective for people who cannot use a keyboard to write. However, the slow speeds of text generation achieved by the participants suggest that people who can use a keyboard to some extent (e.g., slow typists) may not be able to increase their speed by using discrete utterance speech recognition software.

The size of the targets (input switch, keys, symbols, etc.) and the number of targets combine to affect the overall success of the user. In the case of an orthographically based communication aid, a minimum of 27 keys or targets must be employed to allow unique direct selection of the letters of the alphabet and space. This approach is possibly compromised in the instance where a users physical ability does not allow him/her to resolve the individual targets or extend over the range of targets. The effect of this is to introduce additional input errors, and/or reduce the input rate, and can result in the use of slower augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) methods such as encoding and scanning. This paper presents a new model for a communication system that reduces the number of keys to represent the alphabet from 27 to 11. The proposed keyboard employs nine keys, each representing a cluster of three letters, a tenth key dedicated to the space, and an eleventh used for error correction. The model uses fourth-order transitional probabilities to disambiguate among the characters of the three letter clusters. The model has been evaluated with several arrangements of letters against several texts. Measures are presented for the performance of the model in terms of the average keystrokes per letter and percentage correct disambiguation. © 1987, Informa UK Ltd.

Loss of speech, decreased hand use, and severe motor apraxia significantly impact functional communication for this population. Eye gaze is one modality that may be used successfully by individuals with Rett syndrome. This multiple case study explored whether using eye-tracking technology, with ongoing support from a team of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) therapists, could help four participants with Rett syndrome meet individualized communication goals. Two secondary objectives were to examine parents' perspectives on (a) the psychosocial impact of their child’s use of the technology, and (b) satisfaction with using the technology. All four participants were rated by the treating therapists to have made improvement on their goals. According to both quantitative findings and descriptive information, eye-tracking technology was viewed by parents as contributing to participants’ improved psychosocial functioning.

Previous investigators have suggested individuals without deletions typically exhibit stronger cognitive and communicative abilities than their DP counterparts. This investigation focused on several aspects of AAC use: communication systems used; exposure to, success with, and acceptance of electronic AAC devices; and exposure to practices associated with AAC acceptance. Results indicated that both groups rely heavily on unaided, nonsymbolic methods of communication, with the ND group more likely to use conventional, symbolic systems. While the two groups were similar with respect to exposure to an array of electronic devices, the DP group appeared more likely to have gone no further than low-tech devices such as the BIGmack™. There was strong evidence of both groups' capabilities for success with high-tech devices and overall acceptance of devices in terms of duration of use. This proved especially noteworthy in light of both groups' limited exposure to practices associated with AAC acceptance. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed along with future avenues of research. © 2013 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Acceptance; Angelman syndrome; Augmentative and alternative communication; Communication,"Acceptance; Angelman syndrome; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communicative abilities; Electronic device; High-tech devices; Symbolic systems; Speech; Communication; adolescent; article; behavior; child; communication aid; cross-sectional study; female; handicapped child; happy puppet syndrome; human; interpersonal communication; language development; male; parent; preschool child; psychological aspect; Angelman Syndrome; communication aid; handicapped child; parent; psychology; Adolescent; Angelman Syndrome; Behavior; Child; Child Language; Child, Preschool; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disabled Children; Female; Humans; Male; Parents; Adolescent; Angelman Syndrome; Behavior; Child; Child Language; Child, Preschool; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disabled Children; Female; Humans; Male; Parents",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878430639,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,"DynaVox, iPad, iPod, Tech Talk 8, Logan ProxTalker, SuperTalker, CheapTalk, pathfinder, Vantage, Tango, Tech Talk, BIGmack ",Angelman syndrome ,182

A novel dual-output vocal cord vibration switch is described and evaluated for two individuals with severe motor disabilities and complex communication needs. An evaluative case series was performed to compare the new device to its previously proposed single-output counterpart in terms of accuracy, speed and user fatigue. Method. In an ABAB design, participants were followed for up to 16 days as they performed several image matching tasks. Custom-written software recorded the average time taken to match each item, as well as the total number of selection errors. Participants reported their fatigue levels using a modified five-point Borg scale. Results. For one participant, the dual-output version significantly decreased task completion time and selection error (p>0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), thus improving her communication ability. For the second participant, no significant differences were observed between the single- and dual-output systems. Fatigue associated with illness and self-reported stress with school exams were identified as limiting factors. Conclusions. The dual-output vocal cord vibration switch provides a promising new alternative for individuals with severe and multiple disabilities who are able to hum or produce vocalizations. Both participants expressed desire to continue using the device for educational and entertainment purposes. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.",augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); complex communication needs; dual-output access switch; vocal cord vibration; voice switch,"adolescent; adult; article; case report; communication aid; disability; disabled person; female; health survey; human; interpersonal communication; male; nonparametric test; self help; self report; vibration; vocal cord; Adolescent; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Disability Evaluation; Disabled Persons; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Self Report; Self-Help Devices; Statistics, Nonparametric; Vibration; Vocal Cords; Young Adult",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856555707,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Dual-output vocal cord vibration switch ,"Cerebral palsy, hypotonia ",2

It is a software environment for building componentbased AAC applications, grounded on the Design for All principles and a hybrid-community and commercial-Open Source development model. ITHACA addresses the developers, the vendors, as well as the people who use AAC. We introduce a new viewpoint on the AAC product design-developdistribute lifecycle, and a novel way to search-select-modify-maintain the AAC aid. ITHACA provides programmers with a set of tools and reusable Open Source code for building AAC software components. It also facilitates AAC product vendors to put together sophisticated applications using the available on the Web, independently premanufactured, free or commercial software parts. Furthermore, it provides people who use AAC with a variety of compatible AAC software products which incorporate multimodal, user-tailored interfaces that can fulfill their changing needs. The ITHACA architecture and the proposed fusion of past and current approaches, trends and technologies are explained. ITHACA has been successfully applied by implementing a family of AAC products, based on interchangeable components. Several ready to use ITHACA-based components, including on-screen keyboards, Text-to-Speech, symbol selection sets, e-chatting, emailing, and scanning-based input, as well as four complete communication aids addressing different user cases have been developed. This demonstration showed good acceptance of the ITHACA applications and substantial improvement of the end users' communication skills. Developers' experience on working in ITHACA's Open Source projects was also positively evaluated. More importantly, the potential contribution of the component-based framework and Open Source development model combination to the AAC community emerged. © 2010 ACM.",Augmentative and Alternative Communication; Component; Design for All; Framework; Open Source,Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Commercial software; Communication aids; Communication skills; Component based; Component-based framework; Design for all; End users; Multi-modal; On-screen keyboard; Open source development; Open source frameworks; Open source projects; Open sources; Open-source code; Product vendors; Software component; Software environments; Software products; Text to speech; Computer programming; Computer software reusability; Human computer interaction; Human rehabilitation engineering; Product design; Speech communication,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651536725,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,n/a ,4

Word prediction, including context specific prediction, has been proposed to help overcome barriers to the use of these devices (e.g., slow communication rates and limited access to situation-related vocabulary), but has not been tested in terms of effects during actual task performance. In this study, we compared AAC device use, task performance, and user perceptions across three tasks, in conditions where the AAC device used either was, or was not, primed with task specific vocabularies. The participants in this study were adults with normal physical, cognitive, and communication abilities. Context priming had a marginally significant effect on AAC device use as measured by keystroke savings; however, these advantages did not translate into higher level measures of rate, task performance, or user perceptions. In contrast, there were various statistically significant process and performance differences across task type. Additionally, results for two different emulations of human performance showed significant keystroke savings across context conditions. However, these effects were mitigated in actual performance and did not translate into keystroke savings.

Aims: This study presents the case of a professor with aphasia, JK, who resumed teaching through a combination of voice-output technology and the Key Word Teaching technique. Researchers investigated student attitudes towards two teaching approaches - one utilising voice-output technology alone and the other combining voice-output with the Key Word Teaching technique. Methods & procedures: Ten student participants attended two simulated class sessions - one utilising voice-output technology alone and the other combining voice-output with the Key Word Teaching technique. Investigators analysed attitudinal survey results using nonparametric analyses. Qualitative approaches were employed to analyse transcripts of focus group discussions and written teaching evaluations. The investigators also compared university-based teaching evaluations from before JK's stroke to results obtained after the training protocol was completed. In addition, investigators videotaped and reviewed in-class teaching examples. Outcomes & results: In the Combined condition, students rated the professor and the presentation more positively on dependent measures related to rate, comfort, understandability, and their willingness to participate. In a ranking task, all students preferred the Combined teaching approach. The scores on JK's university-based teaching evaluations provided by her students the semester after Key Word Teaching training were similar to evaluations from before her stroke. In addition, excerpts from JK's classroom discourse revealed that she was now combining natural speech and synthesised speech output to enhance her teaching. Conclusions: Results suggest that students preferred the Combined teaching approach utilising both the synthesised speech from the computer and the Key Word Teaching technique. Also, the training protocol enabled JK to combine natural speech and synthesised computer output within the classroom setting in ways that she had been unable to prior to training. The results demonstrate how a thorough analysis of JK's communication needs, accompanied by explicit training in techniques to overcome barriers to participation, resulted in a successful vocational outcome that enabled JK to retain an important aspect of her identity. © 2005 Psychology Press Ltd.",,adult; aphasia; article; attitude; audiovisual equipment; computer aided design; computer program; female; human; intermethod comparison; nonparametric test; qualitative analysis; simulation; teacher; teaching; videorecording; work resumption,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-19144367121,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,EZ keys ,Aphasia ,11

The case studies were analysed using the four nested systems of the ecology as a framework to describe not only the environment, but also the processes and interactions between the persons and their context. Results: Risk and opportunity factors are evident at all levels of the ecology. Conclusions: While a good fit between the person and the technology is an essential starting point, additional factors pertaining to the partner, the immediate environment as well as meso-, exo- and macrosystemic issues (such as societal attitudes and funding sources) have a significant influence on benefits derived. In resource-limited environments, the lack of support at more distal levels of the ecology (meso-, exo- and marosystemic levels) seems to be a factor that differentiates these environments from more resourced ones. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",Augmentative and alternative communication; Children with severe physical disabilities; Eye gaze access; Graphic symbols; Little or no functional speech,case report; child; communication aid; computer interface; cooperation; eye; female; handicapped child; human; needs assessment; poverty; rehabilitation; South Africa; Child; Communication Aids for Disabled; Cooperative Behavior; Disabled Children; Eye; Female; Humans; Needs Assessment; Poverty; South Africa; User-Computer Interface,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929338465,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,Grid 2,"Cerebral palsy, Children ",2

In this study, the elements of narrative that emerged in the interactions between an 8-year-old child who used an AAC device and her teacher are described. This assessment was achieved through use of the Narrative Assessment Profile (Bliss, McCabe, & Miranda, 1998) in the context of five tasks designed to elicit a spectrum of narrative features. Results indicate that the interactions between the child and her teacher made it difficult to assess whether or not the child had control of certain features of narrative. From a purely structural analysis, most narrative discourse dimensions appeared to be severely compromised and therefore in need of immediate intervention.

For these people, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies may offer opportunities for improved communication effectiveness. However, it can be challenging to determine if individuals can learn to use alternative communication strategies independently or if they will require assistance from conversational partners to participate in meaningful communication interactions. Aims: The authors developed an assessment tool, the Multimodal Communication Screening Task for Persons with Aphasia (MCST-A; Garrett & Lasker, 2005b), to help clinicians differentiate those individuals who would benefit most from partner-dependent communication strategies (e.g., written choice conversation, partner-presented symbol choices, tagged yes/no questions) and those who could learn to use AAC systems (e.g., digitised speech devices that store complete messages; multi-level devices with stored messages and spelling capabilities) to communicate independently. This article describes the tool and its administration protocol. We also compare MCST-A scores to profiles of actual communication strategy use for four individuals across a range of aphasia severity. Methods & procedures: Four individuals with communication disabilities associated with aphasia were asked to locate pictorial, textual, or graphic symbols from an eight-page stimulus manual to communicate simple needs and complex concepts, complete simple categories, tell and retell stories, or use partial spelling to convey novel information. Accuracy of responses and the amount and type of cueing required to complete each simulated communication task were tallied for each individual. MCST-A test results are discussed in light of each individual's observed pattern of AAC strategy and system use both during and following functional communication treatment. Results: Descriptive analyses of the four cases revealed a correspondence between MCST-A test scores, level of impairment as measured by the Western Aphasia Battery (Kertesz, 1982), and patterns of communication strategy use. The two individuals who received the lowest response accuracy scores and the highest cueing scores on the MCST-A were primarily dependent on partner-supported communication strategies in their daily lives. The two individuals with the lowest cueing scores and highest response accuracy scores had learned to use complex AAC communication devices to communicate independently and generatively in community settings. Conclusions: The hierarchy of scores seen on the MCST-A corresponded with individuals' abilities to communicate using AAC strategies after participating in functional therapy. The MCST-A may guide clinicians in identifying the most appropriate AAC strategies for individuals with aphasia. Further validation is warranted. © 2006 Psychology Press Ltd.",,adult; aged; aphasia; article; association; case report; clinical protocol; communication disorder; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; disease association; disease severity; female; human; male; multimodal communication screening test for persons with aphasia; scoring system; screening test; simulation; spelling; stimulus response; storytelling; task performance; verbal communication; visual stimulation,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645850730,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Multimodal Communication Screening,Aphasia ,4

Although the field is expanding to include a range of people who use AAC, there are limitations and gaps in research that will need to be addressed in order to keep pace with the rapid evolution of social media connectivity in assistive communication technologies. In this paper, we consider the aims, scope, and methodologies of AAC social media research, with a focus on social network sites. Lack of detailed attention to specific social network sites and little use of social media data limits the extent to which findings can be confirmed. Increased use of social media data across a range of platforms, including Instagram and YouTube, would provide important insights into the lives of people who use AAC and the ways in which they and their supporters use social media.

Discussion focuses on how shared meaning—called common ground—is achieved, the process of grounding utterances under real-time constraints, and how the media characteristics of devices affect the grounding process. A joint action analysis of grounding will be applied to examples of word-board and Voice Output Communication Aid (VOCA)-mediated conversations to show how participants organize their talk around specific media constraints to conduct their conversations and solve communication problems. The authors argue that this model of device-mediated communication performance, or some variety of it, has the potential to reconcile many of the individual research findings in this field within a single explanatory framework. If successful, this approach could be used to evaluate future research with an empirically-based model of communication performance. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Augmentative and alternative communication; Conversation; Design; Grounding; Interaction; Joint action,communication aid; communication disorder; equipment design; human; human relation; interpersonal communication; language; review; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Barriers; Equipment Design; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Language,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038314446,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,AAC users,n/a

In Phase 1, the frequency of augmented requests and natural speech were compared under three speech-output conditions (no-output, short-output, and long-output). In Phase 2, augmented requests in the long-output condition were no longer reinforced to determine if this would increase natural speech production. The presence and length of speech output did not influence the frequency of augmented requesting or natural speech production in Phase 1, but extinction of augmented requesting under the long-output condition in Phase 2 was associated with a significant increase in natural speech production under that condition, relative to the two other conditions.

For some, traditional speech-language therapy aids in regaining verbal communication. For other aphasic individuals these techniques are unsuccessful. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) provides a means of communicating through devices/techniques when spoken skills are not adequate. Individuals with chronic NA can use AAC to communicate; however, many investigations do not include strategies to facilitate communication or caregiver participation. Also, variables influencing treatment efficiency (length, intensity) have not been sufficiently evaluated. Aims: The current study expanded on Johnson, Hough, King, Vos, and Jeffs (2008), investigating if a gentleman with severe, chronic NA could learn to use an AAC device, monitoring communication skill improvement periodically throughout treatment. Methods & Procedures: TE, a 56-year-old left-handed, Caucasian male with severe NA and apraxia of speech resulting from left CVA participated. The Western Aphasia Battery-Revised and ASHA FACS were administered pre-treatment, at 1 and 2 months, and post-treatment. The American Speech-Language Hearing Association Quality of Communication Life Scale and Communicative Effectiveness Index were administered pre- and post-treatment. The AAC device used was Dialect by Zygo with Speaking Dynamically Pro. The treatment protocol was similar to Koul, Corwin, and Hayes (2005) and Johnson et al. (2008). Treatment was 1 hour, 4 days weekly, over 3 months. The first stage, four-level symbol identification, organised a hierarchical structure in which TE was to identify each symbol on the display. The second stage involved navigation to category, choosing a symbol requested by the clinician, which evolved into scenario role-play; TE was asked questions about life situations and daily schedules. The next phase, sentences, involved answering questions about everyday activities/ interests with short phrases using symbols. The spouse received training that included overview on navigating symbol levels, hierarchy structure used with symbols, facilitation strategies, and cues/prompts to incorporate device use outside therapy. Outcomes & Results: Results revealed that TE performed all stages of the treatment programme, allowing progression to each phase of treatment. He completed the programme in 40 therapy sessions. WAB scores (AQ, CQ) showed that performance continually improved on both scores throughout the entire protocol, with most increases in the last month. ASHA FACS scale ratings also yielded continuous increases throughout the regimen for all communication scales. Conclusions: Findings support previous research indicating that individuals with chronic NA can learn symbol-meaning association using AAC.

The study investigated CAC during the first year of its use in real life settings. The implementation process of CAC was highly individual and context dependent. During the study all of the speech-impaired participants learned to operate their CAC devices. Their initial enthusiasm began to decline three to six months after the participants received their devices. At the end of the study year, the CAC devices were hardly used for face-to-face communication, but they were used mainly for educational purposes, written communication, or play and leisure. The main reasons for not using the CAC devices were their poor usability, slow operation speeds and insufficient vocabularies, as well as a lack of related services. The speech-impaired children considered the CAC devices important for them and primarily helpful for schoolwork and play. © 2004 - IOS Press and the authors.

Work completed to date includes the development and evaluation of the language activity monitor function, which now is commercially available in three forms: (1) a standard feature built into modern high performance AAC systems, (2) an external add-on package for use with older AAC devices based on synthetic speech, and (3) software that allows the personal computer to serve as an LAM in the clinical environment. The LAM records the time and content of language events (the generation of one or more letters or words). A logging protocol suitable for clinical application has been in use since late 1998.

Sixteen able-bodied subjects (college students) used one of eight possible device/input method combinations to copy text or engage in a scripted interactive communication task. The printed outputs were analyzed for the number of words generated and the number of errors made. The electronic communication devices included the Equalizer, the EvalPAC, the ScanWRITER, and the Apple Macintosh with Screen-typer software. The input selection methods included row-column scanning with a single switch, directed scanning using a joystick, and direct selection/access using head control. Analyses of the subjects printed outputs, produced following short-term training, showed that the input selection method was a significant factor in text input rate for both text copying and interactive communication. The input method had no significant effect, however, on accuracy during either text copying or interactive communication. Surprisingly, the specific electronic communication device had little or no significant effect on rate or accuracy when the input selection method was the same. Direct selection using the EvalPAC's head mounted light pointer was by far the fastest of the device/input method combinations tested. For some of the communication devices examined, joystick control of the cursor was more rapid or accurate than single switch row-column scanning. Error types and frequencies of their occurrence were similar for both text copying and interactive communication tasks. The two most common types of errors were the insertion or omission of characters or spaces. © 1993, Informa UK Ltd.

The goal of these two pilot experiments was to examine differences in conversational performance of adults with Alzheimer's disease related to the presence and absence of an aid, the type of symbol embedded in the aid, and the presence or absence of voice output. In Experiment 1, 30 adults with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease participated in 10-min conversations with and without personalized AAC boards. There was no effect of AAC, regardless of symbol type, and a deleterious effect of voice output. In Experiment 2, modified spaced-retrieval training preceded conversations, standardized prompts were presented, and semantically-based dependent variables were examined. For the 11 participants in the second experiment, there was a significant effect of AAC, showing that the presence of AAC was associated with greater use of targeted words during personal conversations.

The anticipatory techniques, which include both letter and word anticipation, are directed at scanning methods of message production. The objective of these techniques is to reduce the number of equivalent switch activations needed to produce a message. Letter anticipation is based on the probabilities of letter pairs (digrams). The letters in the selection array are organized by their likelihood of following the last selected letter (or space). Letters of higher probability are placed in positions within the array which require fewer equivalent switch activations to select. Letters of lower probability are placed in those positions which require more equivalent switch activations. Each time a letter is selected, the array is reorganized to reflect the changed digram probabilities for the selected letter. Once the user selects the initial two letters of a word, the PACA presents a group of words as predictions for completing the word. In the prototype PACA the words were derived from a fixed set of core words and a user-defined set of learned words. The core words represent words which have generally high frequencies of occurrence in American English. The learned words include words particular to the individual user and to the topics and situations of that user. Learned words are automatically incorporated into the word list when the user first spells them in the course of creating a message and are automatically discarded if not utilized. In the selection groups, the words are ranked by their frequency of use. The PACA was implemented on a commercial portable computer, the Epson HX-20, and provided with features appropriate for augmenting conversational communication, note-taking, and writing. Three individuals, all with severe physical impairments and users of augmentative communication systems, were selected to evaluate the implementation of the anticipatory techniques in their day-to-day communication needs. Personal observations of the evaluators were complemented with formal observations of their operation of the PACA and analysis of changes in their learned vocabularies. The impressions of the evaluators supported the general efficacy of anticipatory techniques for improving the efficiency of message production. Analysis of word use and the makeup of the learned vocabularies led to several changes in the presentation, manipulation, and structure of the vocabulary used for word anticipation. © 1987, Informa UK Ltd.

We observed 23 students for a total of 117 hours across general education, special education, and non-academic settings. For each communication event, we recorded the setting, communication partner, student communication mode, availability of the AAC system, independent or prompted responses, and the consequence. Communication events primarily occurred with adults and very few spontaneous initiations were observed. On average, students were presented with 17 opportunities to respond per hour. However, in nearly half of these opportunities, students did not have access to their AAC system. Results from our observations indicated more deliberate efforts are needed to ensure students have appropriate access and opportunity to use AAC systems across school environments. © 2016 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",augmentative and alternative communication; Communication opportunities; communication opportunities; complex communication needs,"Education; Human rehabilitation engineering; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communication mode; Communication partners; Complex communication needs; Elementary schools; General education; Naturally occurring; Special education; Students; adult; clinical article; elementary student; human; special education; child; communication aid; communication disorder; education; female; human relation; interpersonal communication; male; school; student; Child; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Disorders; Education, Special; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Schools; Students",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994351176,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,SGD,"Autism, Intellectual disabilities IDD, Elementary school students with AAC ",23

However, AAC strategies can be employed for individuals with aphasia across a wide range of severity levels and at different stages of recovery. For individuals with chronic impairments in language, voice recognition software can further enhance communication by providing an alternative means for written expression. Aims: To investigate the functional and linguistic effects of a treatment program that used voice recognition software to improve written communication in an individual with chronic aphasia. Methods &amp; Procedures: A 65-year-old woman with conduction aphasia participated in a prospective case study. During baseline testing the individual was evaluated on measures of language (i.e., Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, 3rd edition, Goodglass, Kaplan, &amp; Baressi, 2001; Boston Naming Test, Kaplan, Goodglass, &amp; Weintraub, 2001), computer skills, and functional communication (i.e., ASHA FACs, Frattali et al., 1995; Quality of Communication Life Scales, Paul et al., 2004). A cursory examination of the oral peripheral structure was administered. Treatment consisted of 10 one-hour sessions of training on the Dragon NaturallySpeaking© Program. Following treatment, measures of language, computer skills, quality of life, and functional communication were re-administered. Further, to evaluate if skills in written expression could be utilised to communicate via e-mail, a distance-learning program was implemented. Outcomes &amp; Results: Findings revealed that, with intensive instruction, the participant was able to independently access the computer and the Dragon NaturallySpeaking© Program. At the conclusion of the treatment phase, functional writing abilities approximated spoken communication. Some minor changes in reading, repetition, and conversation were suggested on formal and informal assessment measures. The participant made substantial gains in using the program in her activities of daily living, but only achieved minor success in demonstrating her skills during distance learning. Conclusions: The potential benefits of AAC devices may change throughout the course of recovery from aphasia. New technologies may facilitate gains in communication in individuals with aphasia throughout their lifespan. This study demonstrated that intensive training in the use of voice recognition software can enhance functional writing in an individual with chronic aphasia. Although marked progress in written expression was achieved, transfer of skills for use on the Internet was limited. Clinical management should include assessment of various assistive technologies across different modalities of communication for people at different stages of recovery from aphasia. © 2010 Psychology Press.",Assistive technology; Conduction aphasia; Dysgraphia; Voice recognition software,aged; article; automatic speech recognition; case report; communication skill; computer program; conduction aphasia; device therapy; dysgraphia; e-mail; female; functional assessment; human; language ability; language test; learning; prospective study; quality of life; speech; treatment duration; writing; written language,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551713410,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,Dragon NautrallySpeaking,Aphasia,1

Although the candidacy for these devices is relatively unknown, it has been hypothesised that cognitive deficits have a negative impact on the functional use of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). Deficits of executive functioning are assumed to be particularly important, but other functions, such as memory and semantic processing, may also be relevant. In a previous study (van de Sandt-Koenderman, Wiegers, Wielaert, Duivenvoorden, & Ribbers, in press) we reported the functional effect of TouchSpeak (TS), a computerised communication aid, in a group of stroke patients with severe aphasia. The successful participants showed different levels of proficiency. Some were able to use the system independently and creatively in many situations, some used it independently for trained situations, and others remained partner dependent in using TS. Aims: To find factors associated with the functional success of TS in people with severe aphasia, focusing on memory, executive functioning, semantic processing, and communication skills. Methods & Procedures: The data of 30 patients with severe aphasia were analysed retrospectively. All were trained to use TS in two self-chosen communicative situations. Four outcome levels were differentiated: no use, dependent use, independent use, and extensive use of TS. Pre-training assessment included memory, executive functioning, semantic processing, and communication skills. The four outcome groups were compared regarding age, time post onset, gender, and aphasia type. The role of the cognitive variables was analysed with univariate ANCOVAs with contrast analysis, with correction for age, gender, aphasia type, or time post onset in case of significant differences between the groups on these variables. Outcomes & Results: Seven participants were classified as extensive users of TS, five were independent TS users, and five were partner dependent. In 13 cases there was no functional use of TS. Extensive users were younger than the other outcome groups. Independent of this age effect, there was an effect of semantic processing; the no-use group scored significantly lower on semantics than all other groups. Conclusions: Only a minority of patients with severe aphasia may be expected to become independent, flexible users of high-tech AAC. The finding that functional success was related to semantic processing is clinically important. Prospective studies are needed to support the predictive value of semantic processing for high-tech AAC use. The importance of intact executive functioning is not supported in this study. The broad concept of ""executive functioning"" needs to be studied in more detail in relation to aphasia.",,adult; age distribution; aged; analysis of covariance; aphasia; article; ataxic aphasia; biomedical technology assessment; brain function; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; communication skill; computer assisted therapy; conduction aphasia; disease severity; exploratory research; facilitated communication; female; human; machine learning; male; memory; outcome assessment; pattern recognition; retrospective study; semantics; sex difference; speech therapy,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247580760,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,TouchSpeak,Aphasia ,30

The second study then evaluated a proof-ofconcept prototype in both a lab setting with the researcher and in situ with unfamiliar conversation partners at a local market. Findings suggest that a head-worn approach could better allow wearers to maintain focus on the conversation, reduce reliance on the availability of external tools (e.g., paper and pen) or people, and minimize visibility of the support by others.

Stimulus overselectivity is defined as an atypical limitation in the number of stimuli or stimulus features within an image that are attended to and subsequently learned. Within AAC, the term stimulus could refer to symbols or line drawings on speech-generating devices, drawings or pictures on low-technology systems, and/or the elements within visual scene displays. In this context, overselective attention may result in unusual or uneven error patterns such as confusion between two symbols that share a single feature, or difficulties with transitioning between different types of hardware. We review some of the ways that overselective attention has been studied behaviorally. We then examine how eye tracking technology allows a glimpse into some of the behavioral characteristics of overselective attention. We describe an intervention approach, differential observing responses, that may reduce or eliminate overselectivity, and we consider this type of intervention as it relates to issues of relevance for AAC. © 2014 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",AAC; Eye tracking; Intellectual disability; Overselective attention; Overselectivity,Communication; Speech; AAC; Eye-tracking; Intellectual disability; Overselective attention; Overselectivity; Display devices; attention; communication aid; human; Intellectual Disability; oculography; pathophysiology; photostimulation; Attention; Communication Aids for Disabled; Eye Movement Measurements; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Photic Stimulation,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901978525,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,IDD,n/a

They may also serve as heuristic tools, affording the opportunity to observe language production under radically altered conditions. A communication system that we have termed a ""processing prosthesis"" was directly inspired by the performance hypothesis, the view that processing factors rather than loss of linguistic knowledge underlie aphasic language production disorders. Unlike AAC technology, which focuses on the provision of direct linguistic support in the form of vocabulary items and pre-stored utterances, this system (referred to here and in previous literature as the ""CS"") emphasises indirect support to allow the user to more fully exploit his or her retained language production capabilities. If the CS is effective in facilitating aphasic sentence construction, this may be taken as evidence in support of the performance hypothesis embodied in its design. Aims: We illustrate the interplay between AC technology and psycholinguistic theory by reviewing studies of the CS, and describe some approaches to language remediation that have emerged from this work. Contributions: We review three published studies and preliminary data from a fourth. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of the CS through ""aided"" effects (i.e., the extent to which utterances produced on the system are more structured and/or informative than those produced without the system) and treatment effects (i.e., the impact of a period of CS use on the aphasic individual's spontaneous, unaided speech). Conclusions: The CS data suggest that ""indirect"" support may play an important role in facilitating and treating aphasic sentence production; and, more generally, they demonstrate the bidirectional flow of insight between assistive technology and the psycholinguistic analysis of aphasic disorders. © 2005 Psychology Press Ltd.",,aphasia; article; computer program; data analysis; facilitated communication; human; hypothesis; language processing; linguistics; medical technology; publication; speech analysis; speech articulation; theory,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-30644464731,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"CS, Sentence Shaper",Aphasia,"6, 2, 16 "

Typically, messages in AAC devices are organised using the following two interfaces: (a) grid displays that organise symbols into semantic categories (e.g., food) and (b) scene displays that organise photographs contextually. However, there is no published research comparing the influence of these displays across communicative outcome variables. Aims: The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of a grid display and a scene display across several communicative variables (e.g., conversational turns) during conversational interactions with a communication partner (CP). Additionally, we investigated generalisation to an untrained second conversation in one of the two participants. Methods & Procedures: Two experiments were conducted, and each included a different participant with chronic Broca’s aphasia. In Experiment 1, the participant watched an I Love Lucy episode and was trained to use the grid and scene displays for communicative purposes (e.g., formulating messages with the AAC device). After training, the participant engaged in conversations with a CP using either the grid display or the scene display. Experiment 2 followed the same procedures as Experiment 1; however, this participant watched a second I Love Lucy episode. She did not receive any grid display or scene display training for the second episode. The investigators examined (a) the total conversation time, (b) the number of conversational turns, instances of frustration, and navigational errors, (c) conceptual complexity of utterances, and (d) question response accuracy (measured as a percentage). Results: Descriptive analyses revealed that the participants’ communicative outcomes were superior in the scene display conditions. Specifically, a greater number of conversational turns were taken with fewer instances of frustration and navigational errors. The utterances in the scene display conditions were longer and more complex than utterances in the grid display conditions. Probe question response accuracy was greater in the scene display condition in comparison with grid display condition. Conclusion: The experiments represent a preliminary attempt to measure communicative competence in persons with aphasia (PWA) using different displays. The results suggest that scene displays facilitate a greater number of conversational turns for PWA than the grid displays. Additionally, utterance complexity was greater in the scene display condition. However, these results are limited to two individuals with aphasia, and systematic replication is warranted. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",AAC; cognition; graphic symbols; grid displays; photographs; scene displays,adult; alternative communication; aphasia; aphasia test; Article; case report; clinical article; cognition; computer; conversation; female; grid display; human; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; photography; pilot study; reliability; software; training; visual scene,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008352508,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,DynaVox VMax,Aphasia,2

New technology is promising. People with limited skills in reading and writing can communicate on the phone by using symbols representing words or phrases. METHODS: This interview study examines professionals' views of satisfaction, participation and involvement in daily life in seven individuals with cognitive and communicative disabilities who tried text messaging with picture symbols and speech synthesis in smartphones. The users' experiences of text-messaging are reported elsewhere. RESULTS: The results suggest that texting with picture symbols and speech can increase independence and participation in adults with cognitive and communicative disabilities. Results also point to the necessity of individual assessments. Important factors for user satisfaction include products which can be adapted according to the individual's needs. Speech synthesis, user friendly lay-out and functions making devices easy to handle are necessary. CONCLUSIONS: This study is promising and informative for professionals working with communication technology. It supports enabling of texting today as well as future development of smartphone applications for persons with cognitive and communicative disabilities.© 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

Ten-minute conversations were videotaped in participants' residences and analyzed for four conversational measures related to the participants' communicative behavior. Results show that AAC devices with digitized voice output depress conversational performance and distract participants with moderate Alzheimer's disease as compared to similar devices without voice output.

A prior study that measured utterance length and grammatical complexity in story-plot narratives produced with and without the aid of SentenceShaper demonstrated an ""aided effect"" in some speakers with aphasia, meaning an advantage for the narratives that were produced with the support of this communication aid (Linebarger, Schwartz, Romania, Kohn, & Stephens, 2000). The present study deviated from Linebarger et al.'s methods in key respects and again showed aided effects of SentenceShaper in persons with aphasia. Aims: Aims were (1) to demonstrate aided effects in ""functional narratives"" conveying hypothetical real-life situations from a first person perspective; (2) for the first time, to submit aided and spontaneous speech samples to listener judgements of informativeness; and (3) to produce preliminary evidence on topic-specific carryover from SentenceShaper, i.e., carryover from an aided production to a subsequent unaided production on the same topic. Methods & Procedures: Five individuals with chronic aphasia created narratives on two topics, under three conditions: Unaided (U), Aided (SSR), and Post-SSR Unaided (Post-U). The 30 samples (5 participants, 2 topics, 3 conditions) were randomised and judged for informativeness by graduate students in speech-language pathology. The method for rating was Direct Magnitude Estimation (DME). Outcomes & Results: Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on DME ratings for each participant on each topic. A main effect of Condition was present for four of the five participants, on one or both topics. Planned contrasts revealed that the aided effect (SSR > U) was significant in each of these cases. For two participants, there was also topic-specific carryover (Post-U > U). Conclusions: Listeners judged functional narratives generated on SentenceShaper to be more informative than comparable narratives spoken spontaneously. This extends the evidence for aided effects of SentenceShaper. There was also evidence, albeit weaker, for topic-specific carryover, suggesting that the program might be used effectively to practise for upcoming face-to-face interactions.",,adult; analysis of variance; aphasia; article; biomedical technology assessment; clinical article; clinical trial; communication skill; communication software; computer assisted therapy; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; facilitated communication; female; human; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; language processing; machine learning; male; outcome assessment; phonetics; randomized controlled trial; speech discrimination; speech therapy,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247556432,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,Sentence Shaper,Aphasia ,18

System design (from programming functions to layout options) necessitates a range of skills related to operational competence and can impose intensive training demands for communication partners. In fact, some AAC applications impose considerable learning demands, which can lead to increased time to complete the same programming tasks. A within-subject design was used to investigate the comparative effects of three visual scene display AAC apps (GoTalk Now, AutisMate, EasyVSD) on the programming times for three off-line programming activities, by adults who were novices to programming AAC apps. The results indicated all participants were able to create scenes and add hotspots during off-line programming tasks with minimal self-guided training. The AAC app that had the least number of programming steps, EasyVSD, resulted in the fastest completion times across the three programming tasks. These results suggest that by simplifying the operational requirements of AAC apps the programming time is reduced, which may allow partners to better support individuals who use AAC. © 2017 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Applications (apps); augmentative and alternative communication; complex communication needs; mobile technology; visual scene displays,Personnel training; Telecommunication equipment; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communication partners; Complex communication needs; Mobile Technology; Off line programming; Operational requirements; Programming tasks; Visual scene; Human rehabilitation engineering; adult; female; human; human experiment; male; communication aid; communication disorder; comparative study; information processing; learning; middle aged; mobile application; vocabulary; young adult; Adult; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Disorders; Data Display; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Vocabulary; Young Adult,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031892707,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"GoTalk Now, AutisMate, EasyVSD ",Adults programming AAC ,10

The purpose of this study was to determine which of two AAC interfaces two people with aphasia could use most efficiently and accurately. Method: The researchers used a BCB′C′ alternating treatment design to provide device-use instruction to two people with severe aphasia regarding two personalised AAC interfaces that had different navigation layouts but identical content. One interface had static buttons for homepage and go-back features, and the other interface had static buttons in a navigation ring layout. Throughout treatment, the researchers monitored participants' mastery patterns regarding navigation efficiency and accuracy when locating target messages. Results: Participants' accuracy and efficiency improved with both interfaces given intervention; however, the navigation ring layout appeared more transparent and better facilitated navigation than the homepage layout. Conclusions: People with aphasia can learn to navigate computerised devices; however, interface layout can substantially affect the efficiency and accuracy with which they locate messages.Implications for RehabilitationGiven intervention incorporating errorless learning principles, people with chronic aphasia can learn to navigate across multiple device levels to locate target sentences.Both navigation ring and homepage interfaces may be used by people with aphasia.Some people with aphasia may be more consistent and efficient in finding target sentences using the navigation ring interface than the homepage interface. Additionally, the navigation ring interface may be more transparent and easier for people with aphasia to master-that is, they may require fewer intervention sessions to learn to navigate the navigation ring interface.Generalisation of learning may result from use of the navigation ring interface. Specifically, people with aphasia may improve navigation with the homepage interface as a result of instruction on the navigation interface, but not vice versa. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",AAC; Aphasia; Augmentative communication,adult; aphasia; article; communication aid; equipment design; human; learning; male; Adult; Aphasia; Communication Aids for Disabled; Equipment Design; Humans; Learning; Male,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893967231,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,DynaVox Maestro ,Aphasia,2

Children with physical disabilities and complex communication needs may be limited in their ability to participate. OBJECTIVES: To involve a 12 year old student with cerebral palsy in programming Lego robots in the classroom by using her speech generating device (SGD). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of using the two-switch scanning mode on the SGD for programming. METHODS: The participant tested classmates' robot programs using infrared on her SGD, and she accessed the programming software via a customized mouse manipulation page. Her participation in programming activities was measured with Goal Attainment Scaling, descriptive observations, and measures of effectiveness and efficiency. RESULTS: The participant progressed from observing classmates to independently testing robot programs in the classroom. In individualized sessions she wrote a simple program, with support. Limitations in scanning led to unwanted cursor movements and long task times. CONCLUSIONS: The participant actively participated in the robot programming activity. Actually programming was better suited to individual instruction because of her scanning inefficiency. Using the SGD for robot control affords the potential to also discuss concepts, but this novice user did not yet have the skills to utilize this aspect. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

A recent study demonstrated that when listeners rated the informativeness of functional narratives produced by chronic aphasic speakers with and without the program they gave higher informativeness ratings to the language produced with the aid of the program (Bartlett, Fink, Schwartz, & Linebarger, 2007). Bartlett et al. (2007) also compared unaided (spontaneous) narratives produced before and after the aided version of the narrative was obtained. In a subset of comparisons, the sample created after was judged to be more informative; they called this ""topic-specific carryover"". Aims: (1) To determine whether differences in informativeness that Bartlett et al.'s listeners perceived are also revealed by Correct Information Unit (CIU) analysis (Nicholas & Brookshire, 1993)-a well studied, objective method for measuring informativeness-and (2) to demonstrate the usefulness of CIU analysis for samples of this type. Methods & Procedures: A modified version of the CIU analysis was applied to the speech samples obtained by Bartlett et al. (2007). They had asked five individuals with chronic aphasia to create functional narratives on two topics, under three conditions: Unaided (""U""), Aided (""SSR""), & Post-SSR Unaided (""Post-U""). Here, these samples were analysed for differences in % CIUs across conditions. Linear associations between listener judgements and CIU measures were evaluated with bivariate correlations and multiple regression analysis. Outcomes & Results: (1) The aidedeffect was confirmed: samples produced with SentenceShaper had higher % CIUs, in most cases exceeding 90%. (2) There was little evidence of topic-specific carryover. (3) CIU measures and listener ratings correlated strongly. Conclusions: That the percentage of CIUs was higher in SSR-aided samples than in unaided samples confirms the central finding in Bartlett et al. (2007), based on subjective judgements, and thus extends the evidence that aided effects from SentenceShaper are demonstrable across a range of measures, stimuli and participants (cf. Linebarger, Schwartz, Romania, Kohn, & Stephens, 2000). The data also attest to the effectiveness of the CIU analysis for quantifying differences in the informativeness of aphasic speech with and without SentenceShaper; and they support prior studies that have shown that CIU measures correlate with the informativeness ratings of unfamiliar listeners.",AAC; Aphasia; Functional communication; Informativeness; Sentenceshaper,adult; aphasia; automatic speech recognition; chronic disease; clinical article; computer aided design; computer language; computer program; conference paper; correlation function; female; fluency disorder; human; information processing; language; language processing; male; narrative; speech analysis; verbal communication,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-45949084956,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Sentence Shaper,Aphasia,5

We present Huffman scanning, a new method for applying statistical language models to binary-switch, static-grid typing AAC interfaces, and compare it to other scanning options under a variety of conditions. We present results for 16 adults without disabilities and one 36-year-old man with locked-in syndrome who presents with complex communication needs and uses AAC scanning devices for writing. Huffman scanning with a statistical language model yielded significant typing speedups for the 16 participants without disabilities versus any of the other methods tested, including two row/column scanning methods. A similar pattern of results was found with the individual with locked-in syndrome. Interestingly, faster typing speeds were obtained with Huffman scanning using a more leisurely scan rate than relatively fast individually calibrated scan rates.

Method: A multidisciplinary clinical team of seven individuals representing five disciplines identified requisite skills for the BCI RSVP Keyboard™. They chose questions and subtests from existing standardized instruments for auditory comprehension, reading and spelling, modified them to accommodate nonverbal response modalities, and developed novel tasks to screen visual perception, sustained visual attention and working memory. Questions were included about sensory skills, positioning, pain interference and medications. The result is a compilation of questions, adapted subtests and original tasks designed for this new BCI system. It was administered to 12 PLIS and 6 healthy controls. Results: Administration required 1 h or less. Yes/no choices and eye gaze were adequate response modes for PLIS. Healthy controls and 9 PLIS were 100% accurate on all tasks; 3 PLIS missed single items. Conclusions: The RSVP BCI screening protocol is a brief, repeatable technique for patients with different levels of LIS to identify the presence/absence of skills for BCI use. Widespread adoption of screening methods should be a clinical goal and will help standardize BCI implementation for research and intervention.Implications for RehabilitationPeople with locked-in syndrome must have certain sensory, motor, cognitive and communication skills to successfully use a brain-computer interface (BCI) for communication.A screening profile would be useful in identifying potentially suitable candidates for BCI. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.",Augmentative and alternative communication; Brain-computer interface; Cognition; Locked-in syndrome; Screening,adult; aged; brain computer interface; clinical protocol; communication aid; devices; electroencephalography; female; human; male; middle aged; physiotherapy; quadriplegia; self help device; vision; Adult; Aged; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Clinical Protocols; Communication Aids for Disabled; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physical Therapy Modalities; Quadriplegia; Self-Help Devices; Visual Perception,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918513542,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,RSVP keyboard,LIS,12

Further, motor impairment can restrict the use of movement, including pointing, to signal interest and intent. For some children, controlled gaze can be an effective 'point-substitute': such 'eye-pointing' can be used to request items, establish mutual interest in an event, or select vocabulary within an alternative or augmentative communication (ACC) system. However, in clinical practice there is a lack of clarity about how the term 'eye-pointing' is used, how 'eye-pointing' is recognized or how it relates to social development. Aims To present a clinical description of the term 'eye-pointing' with reference to children with severe cerebral palsy who cannot speak or finger-point. To consider this description within a wider discussion of the importance of gaze in communication development. Methods & Procedures Cumulative clinical observations during assessment of children referred to a specialist multidisciplinary communication clinic have provoked discussion between the authors on what factors precipitate use of the term 'eye-pointing' in young children with severe cerebral palsy. In particular, discussion has centred on whether use of the term is appropriate in individual cases and whether guidance is available about how gaze should be observed in this developmentally vulnerable group of children. A literature search was also conducted in order to explore whether the use and meaning of the term is established. Conclusions & Implications In interactions with non-speaking children, determining whether a child is using eye-gaze communicatively requires observation and interpretation of several factors. These processes will be informed by reflection on what is known about other aspects of the child's communication and interaction skills. Within the literature, the term 'eye-pointing' is sometimes used when describing the communication functions of individuals using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems, and is occasionally qualified by a definition. No papers have been found that set out a clinical description universally applicable to children with severe motor impairment. Moreover, guidance is lacking on how possible episodes of 'eye-pointing' might be confidently distinguished from other episodes of directed gaze in young, developing communicators. The discussion of the term makes reference to the importance of gaze in early communication development, and explores factors that might influence gaze and its interpretation in young children with cerebral palsy. A description of eye-pointing for this group is offered. The authors suggest that this will bring practical benefits to those supporting the communication development of children with severe cerebral palsy. © 2013 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.",cerebral palsy; child; communication,"cerebral palsy; child; communication disorder; eye; eye fixation; human; interpersonal communication; psychological aspect; review; cerebral palsy; communication disorder; psychology; cerebral palsy; child; communication; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Communication; Communication Disorders; Eye; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Communication; Communication Disorders; Eye; Fixation, Ocular; Humans",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883106762,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,Cerebral palsy,n/a

The study was carried out with 30 children with cerebral palsy. A questionnaire was designed to characterize the use of new technologies and assistive devices. Some of the questions were reserved for the teachers. Even though 29 users show some type of communication difficulty, only 4 users dispose of a computer-aided communication device, with the static symbolic board being the most widely used device (4). More than half of the participants (17) regularly use a computer, 16 of them requiring some type of assistive device. The perception of the teachers with regard to the use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) in the classrooms is positive in 5 out of 6 cases. ICTs only provide assistance if their application is accompanied by the involvement of professionals and the child's social environment. The low use of Augmentative and Alternative Communication techniques along with the absence of communication codes reveal the need to establish training protocols. The inclusion of social, physical, and personal factors is considered essential in order to evaluate the needs for assistive technology.

Of interest were specific applications designed to increase attention, use of symbols, reception, expression of choice, awareness of contingencies, and social interaction. Participants included 26 children, aged 3 to 15 years, with DSI and other severe disabilities. A team-collaboration model was utilized in which each child's communication goals were first generated, and intervention activities were then implemented and monitored. One case example is presented to illustrate the multistep process. General results indicated that students with DSI, including those with severe to profound cognitive disabilities, could achieve individualized communication goals through the use of microcomputers and other technological resources. Analysis of intervention goals and activities revealed that, for students with nonsymbolic, nonintentional forms of communication, increasing social attention and contingency awareness was of primary concern.

All systems were provided primarily for symbol-based communication, but were also used for other purposes such as play, leisure and school activities. A further aim was to investigate factors affecting usability, specifically for communication. The study used a qualitative approach, involving content analysis of semistructured interviews with the children’s key persons (N = 11). The analysis yielded three categories and twelve subcategories. There were gains for the children in terms of empowerment, social interaction, learning opportunities and efficient computer use. Inaccessibility, liability issues and technical failure were seen as obstacles, while the prerequisites included time, collaboration, stimulating content, know-how and opportunities.

Whether this increased familiarity has an impact on the interpretation of such sequences or on the relationship between construction and interpretation is fundamental to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying communication using graphic symbols. In this study, individuals who use graphic-symbol AAC systems were asked to construct and interpret graphic-symbol sequences representing the same target content (simple and complex propositions). The majority of participants used stable response patterns on both tasks; a minority were inconsistent on both tasks. Asymmetrical patterns (stable on one task but not the other) were rare, suggesting that neither channel (construction or interpretation) preceded the other, in contrast to earlier findings with participants without disabilities (i.e., novice users of graphic symbols).

Method: Three children with severe physical disabilities and complex communication needs used the robot and SGD system to perform four math measurement lessons in comparing, sorting and ordering objects. The performance of the participants was measured and the process of using the system was described in terms of manipulation and communication events. Stakeholder opinions were solicited regarding robot use. Results: Robot use revealed some gaps in the procedural knowledge of the participants. Access to both the robot and SGD was shown to provide several benefits. Stakeholders thought the intervention was important and feasible for a classroom environment. Conclusions: The participants were able to participate actively in the hands-on and communicative measurement activities and thus meet the demands of current math instruction methods.Implications for RehabilitationCurrent mathematics pedagogy encourages doing hands-on activities while communicating about concepts.Adapted Lego robots enabled children with severe physical disabilities to perform hands-on length measurement activities.Controlling the robots from speech generating devices (SGD) enabled the children, who also had complex communication needs, to reflect and report on results during the activities.By using the robots combined with SGDs, children both exhibited their knowledge of and experienced the concepts of mathematical measurements. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

It takes advantage of a n-gram statistical model applied on letters. SibyWord allows keystroke saving by word completion. It predicts next word using natural language processing techniques. A robust chunk parsing (non-recursive constituent) is achieved and prediction is based on the last chunk heads occurrences. Best predictions are displayed in a word list.

Method: Two separate 1-hour focus groups were conducted with 8 SLPs and 5 parents of children with ASD to identify appealing design features of AAC Apps, their benefits and potential concerns. Participants were shown novel interface designs for communication mode, play mode and incentive systems. Participants responded to poll questions and provided benefits and drawbacks of the features as part of structured discussion. Results: SLPs and parents identified a range of appealing features in communication mode (customization, animation and colour-coding) as well as in play mode (games and videos). SLPs preferred interfaces that supported motor planning and instruction while parents preferred those features such as character assistants that would appeal to their child. Overall SLPs and parents agreed on features for future AAC Apps. Conclusion: SLPs and parents have valuable input in regards to future AAC app design informed by their experiences with children with ASD. Both groups are key stakeholders in the design process and should be included in future design and research endeavors.Implications for Rehabilitation AAC applications for the iPad are often designed based on previous devices without consideration of new features. Ensuring the design of new interfaces are appealing and beneficial for children with ASD can potentially further support their communication. This study demonstrates how key stakeholders in AAC including speech language pathologists and parents can provide information to support the development of future AAC interface designs.

In this work, we describe voicesetting as the process of authoring the speech properties of text. We present the design and evaluation of two voicesetting user interfaces: the Expressive Keyboard, designed for rapid addition of expressivity to speech, and the Voicesetting Editor, designed for more careful crafting of the way text should be spoken. We evaluated the perceived output quality, requisite effort, and usability of both interfaces; the concept of voicesetting and our interfaces were highly valued by end-users as an enhancement to communication quality.

In the present paper, we discuss two approaches to communication using a non-invasive BCI via recording of neurological activity related to motor imagery. The first approach uses modulations of the sensorimotor rhythm related to limb movement imagery to continuously modify the output of an artificial speech synthesizer. The second approach detects event-related changes to neurological activity during single trial motor imagery attempts to control a commercial augmentative and alternative communication device. These two approaches represent two extremes for BCI-based communication ranging from simple, “button-click” operation of a speech generating communication device to continuous modulation of an acoustic output speech synthesizer. The goal of developing along a continuum is to facilitate adoption and use of communication BCIs to a heterogeneous target user population. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",AAC; BCI; Brain-computer interface; Motor imagery,Cognitive systems; Human computer interaction; Human rehabilitation engineering; Interfaces (computer); Modulation; Neurology; Speech communication; Speech synthesis; Walking aids; Assistive devices; Augmentative and alternative communication devices; Communication device; Continuous modulation; Environmental interactions; Motor imagery; Motor impairments; Speech synthesizer; Brain computer interface,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978891185,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,EEG,Motor disabilities ,10

Some AAC users apply telegraphic language, as they attempt to speed up the interactive communication or because they are language impaired. In many AAC aids, a “sentence” is formulated by combining symbols of an icon-based communication system. To be accepted by the communication partner, the output should be a correct oral sentence of a natural language. In this paper we present our effort to develop a novel technique for expanding spontaneous telegraphic input to well-formed Greek sentences, by adopting a feature-based surface realization for Natural Language generation. We first describe the general architecture of the system that accepts compressed, incomplete, grammatically and syntactically ill-formed text and produces a correct full sentence. The NLP techniques of the two main modules, named preprocessor and translator/ generator, are then analyzed. A prototype system has been developed using Component Based Technology (CBT) which is under field evaluation by a number of speech-disabled users. Currently it supports fully the BLISS and MAKATON icon based communication systems.

Volunteering also provides a positive contribution to society, and an opportunity to participate in activities that may differ from those in paid employment. People with severe disabilities and complex communication needs, however, may face significant barriers in participating and communicating in volunteer activities. A multiple-probe-across-participants, single-case experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of videos with integrated visual scene displays (video VSDs). The video VSDs were presented using a tablet-based augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) app, as an intervention to increase the percent of steps completed independently within a volunteer activity. Participants were four adolescents with autism spectrum disorder or Down syndrome, all of whom had complex communication needs. Each participant met the mastery criterion for the activity–completion of the volunteer work activities and communication exchanges with co-volunteers–with the use of the video VSDs.

In this project, we aimed to identify areas that parents and SLPs consider should be included in training for families with a new SGD. Methods: Seven parents of children with an SGD and three SLPs who were new to the SGD field, participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Ten SLPs experienced in SGD practice took part in two focus groups. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods. Results: Participants identified the following areas suitable for inclusion in a family SGD training package: (a) content aimed at improving acceptance and uptake of the SGD, including technical guidance, customisation and reassurance around SGD misconceptions; (b) content around aided language development and (c) home practice strategies, including responsivity, aided language stimulation and managing childrens motivation. Conclusions: Participants identified diverse training targets, many of which are unexplored in parent-training research to date. Their recounted experiences illustrate the diversity of family capacity, knowledge and training priorities, and highlight the need for collaborative planning between families and SLPs at all stages of SGD training.Implications for RehabilitationTraining needs for families with a new speech generating device (SGD) are diverse, ranging from technology-specific competencies to broader areas, such as advocacy, teamwork and goal-setting skills.Each family with a new SGD will have a unique profile of training needs, determined by individual learning capacity, priorities, prior knowledge and experience, as well as their childs current communication skills and future support needs.Parents and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) may hold different priorities concerning family SGD training, necessitating ongoing team discussion. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",Augmentative and alternative communication; Communication partner training; Parent training; Speech generating device,"child; clinical article; communication skill; family; grounded theory; human; information processing; language development; learning; motivation; reassurance; semi structured interview; speech; speech language pathologist; teamwork; adolescent; attitude to health; communication aid; education; family; female; interview; male; organization and management; parent; preschool child; psychology; speech disorder; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Communication Aids for Disabled; Family; Female; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Language Development; Male; Parents; Speech-Language Pathology",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962858041,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,"SGD, iPad","ASD, IDD, Cerebral Palsy",20

The dense packaging of visual information requires high fidelity and high bandwidth of the captured data. Even though marker-based optical motion capture provides many desirable features such as high accuracy, global fitting, and the ability to record body and face simultaneously, it is not widely used to record finger motion, especially not for articulated and syntactic motion such as signs. Instead, most signing avatar projects use costly instrumented gloves, which require long calibration procedures. In this article, we evaluate the data quality obtained from optical motion capture of isolated signs from Swedish sign language with a large number of low-cost cameras. We also present a novel dual-sensor approach to combine the data with lowcost, five-sensor instrumented gloves to provide a recording method with low manual postprocessing. Finally, we evaluate the collected data and the dual-sensor approach as transferred to a highly stylized avatar.

The teacher professional learning intervention and the effect on teacher performance were discussed in detail. Part 2 of the study demonstrated the effect of teacher performance on student learning outcomes. This study demonstrated that there was no effect on student SGD use during teacher learning Phase 1 (device operation). However, all students showed substantial increases in SGD initiations during teacher learning Phase 2 (integration and embedding), and SGD initiations remained at high levels through teacher learning Phase 3 (systematic communication instruction). SGD initiations increased further for students with the most significant disabilities during teacher learning Phase 3. Overall, minimal effects were found for student SGD responses. This study has implications for service provision to students who use SGDs and/or other assistive technology (AT) in the classroom.

In order to meet their diverse communication needs (e.g., face-to-face, written, Internet, telecommunication), these children may use mainstream technologies accessed via the mouse, yet little is known about factors that affect the mouse performance of young children. This study used a mixed factorial design to investigate the effects of age, target size, and angle of approach on accuracy and time required for accurate target selection with a mouse for 20 3-year-old and 20 4-year-old children. The 4-year-olds were generally more accurate and faster than the 3-year-olds. Target size and angle mediated differences in performance within age groups. The 3-year-olds were more accurate and faster in selecting the medium and large targets relative to the small target, were faster in selecting the large relative to the medium target, and were faster in selecting targets along the vertical relative to the diagonal angle. The 4-year-olds were faster in selecting the medium and large targets relative to the small target. Implications for improving access to AAC include the preliminary suggestion of age-related threshold target sizes that support sufficient accuracy, the possibility of efficiency benefits when target size is increased up to an age-related threshold, and identification of the potential utility of the vertical angle as a context for training navigational input device use. © 2012 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Augmentative communication; Children; Computer access; Motor control,"Age groups; Age-related; Augmentative communication; Children; Children with autisms; Complex communication needs; Computer access; Computer mouse; Diverse communications; Down syndrome; Efficiency benefits; Factorial design; Input devices; Motor control; Motor impairments; Potential utility; Small targets; Special education services; Target selection; Target size; Young children; Access control; Communication; Mammals; Education; age; analysis of variance; article; autism; bioengineering; communication aid; computer; human; preschool child; psychomotor performance; Age Factors; Analysis of Variance; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Child, Preschool; Communication Aids for Disabled; Computer Peripherals; Human Engineering; Humans; Psychomotor Performance",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861927465,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,n/a,40

This is despite the fact that key aspects of AAC research are concerned with the treatment of natural language, and that communication aids appear to represent an ideal means of applying advanced NLP techniques. The lack of NLP research in relation to AAC is partially due to the tendency to focus NLP activities on solving particular problems from constructed examples, rather than the treatment of unrestricted language. Today, however, the face of NLP research has changed significantly, thanks to the increasing availability of and need to process larger corpora. This has prompted a quest for robust solutions to treat unrestricted text, which, in turn, has had two key results: (a) an influx of statistical techniques and (b) the emergence of comprehensive, language-related resources such as broad coverage electronic dictionaries.

To date, treatments based on intersystemic reorganization have focused on writing, drawing, and gesturing. Further, despite a movement to identify neural mechanisms that support intervention-related recovery, the neurobiological markers of AAC-induced changes have not been established. Aims: The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to examine the feasibility of providing a high-tech AAC treatment to people with chronic aphasia, with the goal of evoking changes in spoken language; and (2) to identify evidence of AAC-induced changes in brain activation. Method and Procedures: We employed a pre- and post-treatment design with a control (usual care) group to observe the impact of an AAC treatment on aphasia severity and spoken discourse. Further, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine associated neural reorganization. Outcomes and Results: Compared to the usual care group, the AAC intervention trended toward larger treatment effects and resulted in a higher number of responders on behavioral outcomes. Both groups demonstrated a trend toward greater leftward lateralization of language functions via fMRI. Secondary analyses of responders to treatment revealed increased activation in visual processing regions, primarily for the AAC group. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary guidance regarding how to implement AAC treatment in a manner that simultaneously facilitates language recovery across a variety of aphasia types and severity levels while compensating for residual deficits in people with chronic aphasia. Further, this work motivates continued efforts to unveil the role of AAC-based interventions in the aphasia recovery process and provides insight regarding the neurobiological mechanisms supporting AAC-induced language changes. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Aphasia; augmentative and alternative communication; cortical plasticity; fMRI; neuroimaging,biological marker; adult; aged; aphasia; Article; behavior; chronic disease; clinical article; controlled study; disease severity; electroencephalogram; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; language; male; methodology; nervous system parameters; oral communication; reliability; speech rehabilitation,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043312782,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,DynaVox Vmax,Aphasia,12

Method: In this work, a mobile AAC app was developed based on results from research studies. Sophisticated AAC language programming, embedded training materials, and real-time communication performance reporting were integrated into the app. Two groups of study participants were recruited to participate a usability study and a preliminary feasibility study for the purpose of evaluating this mobile AAC app, respectively. Results: A tablet-based AAC app was developed to support communication rehabilitation. User studies of the app were conducted and included able-bodied individuals and people with verbal communication disabilities. All study participants agreed that the app establishes a usable alternative treatment protocol for communication rehabilitation. Conclusions: The app’s integrated features have great potential to maximize users’ communication effectiveness, enhance language skills, and ultimately improve users’ quality of life.Implications for rehabilitation We have developed and evaluated an integrated mobile AAC language-based app. This tablet-based app integrated AAC with embedded trainings and real-time performance report. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",augmentative and alternative communication; communication disabilities; mHealth; telehealth; usability study,"adult; communication aid; communication disorder; computer interface; female; human; language; male; mobile application; personal digital assistant; procedures; quality of life; speech disorder; telemedicine; young adult; Adult; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Disorders; Computers, Handheld; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Mobile Applications; Quality of Life; Speech-Language Pathology; Telemedicine; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029902213,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"EuTalk, Tablet",n/a,20

Materials and methods: Five children ages 5–10 years with permanent bilateral hearing loss who were identified with language underperformance participated in an individualized 24-week structured program using the application TouchChat WordPower on iPads®. Language samples were analyzed for changes in mean length of utterance, vocabulary words and mean turn length. Repeated measures models assessed change over time. Results: The baseline median mean length of utterance was 2.41 (range 1.09–6.63; mean 2.88) and significantly increased over time (p = 0.002) to a median of 3.68 at final visit (range 1.97–6.81; mean 3.62). At baseline, the median total number of words spoken per language sample was 251 (range 101–458), with 100 (range 36–100) different words spoken. Total words and different words significantly increased over time (β = 26.8 (7.1), p = 0.001 for total words; β = 8.0 (2.7), p = 0.008 for different words). Mean turn length values also slightly increased over time.

The current study, conducted with adults without disabilities using a within-subject experimental design, compared the effects of two different SGD trainings on speed and accuracy of locating words via an SGD interface. During size-centered training, participants were introduced to six large icons that completely filled an SGD screen. During location-centered training, participants were introduced to six small icons on a 40-location screen where other icons were hidden. After the training, participants were asked to find the trained items on a 40-location screen with all 40 icons visible. Accuracy and speed of response were analyzed, and the study found that participants located targets faster and more accurately following location-centered training vs. following size-centered training.

Many of these individuals are children and neo-literates who have little proficiency in their language of communication. In order to cater to such individuals in India, we have developed Sanyog, an icon-based communication aid. Sanyog accepts a sequence of icons as input and converts the input sequence to a grammatically correct sentence. Conversion of an iconic sequence to a sentence requires linguistic knowledge and resources that are not available for Bengali and Hindi, the two Indian languages for which Sanyog was developed. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel user-computer interaction model. The interaction is facilitated by a suitably designed interface. The interaction model and the interface designed for Sanyog are presented in this article.

Qualitative data related to barriers and facilitators were synthesized from 42 studies located using a systematic search. A diverse range of studies was examined in order to identify the span of barriers and facilitators reported in the literature. Included studies comprised quasi-experimental, non-experimental, and qualitative study designs. The full range of unaided, low-tech aided, and high-tech aided AAC systems were reported across the included studies. The critical synthesis identified 5 themes to which barriers and facilitators are related: (a) Intervention Services and Service Providers, (b) AAC Systems and Technologies (c), Communication Partners of Children with ASD, (d) Parents of Children with ASD, and (e) Children with ASD. The findings suggest that barriers and facilitators to the use of AAC vary across individuals, AAC modalities, and environments. By identifying barriers and facilitators to the use of AAC experienced by children with ASD and their communication partners, service providers might be better equipped to support these children and their communication partners.

Despite this handicap, they can become effective communicators by using different graphic or symbol systems. One of these non-verbal graphic systems is Blissymbolics. Bliss symbols are a set of simple pictograms, each representing a single object or concept. In recent years several computer-based tools have been developed to combine Bliss symbols with a speech synthesizer, providing an electronic communication tool for users with disabilities. The Hungarian-speaking Blissvox system was created for this purpose. The users of the program can assemble messages by putting symbols together. The messages are stored automatically and can be recalled and displayed or printed at any time. The system uses the Multivox Hungarian formant synthesizer to utter the messages in a synthetic voice. Due to the rich morphology of Hungarian, sentences made up from the words representing Bliss symbols are ungrammatical. A linguistic module was developed to transform the string of isolated words of the assembled messages into grammatically correct sentences. This module is comprised of a morphological and a syntactic generator with constrained rules and vocabulary. The paper presents this enhanced Blissvox, giving a general technical description of the modules.

Thus, this study aimed to (a) investigate the effects of a Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) Phase IV protocol on the acquisition of spontaneous augmented requests, (b) evaluate the impact of progressive time delay and synthetic speech output on the development of vocal requests, and (c) determine the participants’ preferences for each modality after reaching mastery. A multiple-baseline design across four children with ASD was used to measure the acquisition of augmented and vocal requests during the transition from low-tech to high-tech AAC systems. During a natural condition (i.e., playtime), a modified PECS Phase IV protocol was applied to teach the participants to request by producing multisymbol messages (e.g., I WANT + names of a preferred item) using an iPad as well as vocalizations. After mastery, the participants’ preference for using the modified PECS Phase IV app or the communication book was assessed by comparing the response allocations. The preliminary results suggest that the modified PECS protocol can be used to transition from a low- to high-tech communication modality. © 2020 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS); Speech production; Speech-generating devices (SGD),"Human rehabilitation engineering; Speech synthesis; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Baseline design; Children with autisms; Communication modalities; Natural conditions; Protocol cans; Speech production; Synthetic speech; Speech communication; autism; communication aid; communication disorder; female; human; male; preschool child; speech; technology; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child, Preschool; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Speech; Technology",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092177720,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"PECS IV+ app, iPad","ASD, Children",4

Method: Fifteen SLPs were recruited throughout Sweden. The SLPs answered a study-specific questionnaire on communication partner training in relation to communication partners to children with severe cerebral palsy and intellectual disability. The results were analysed with descriptive statistics (closed-ended questions, responses on Likert scales) and content analysis (open-ended question) using ICF-CY. Results: Twelve SLPs completed the survey. Half had no or one training session with communication partners in the last year. One-third never used documents for goal-setting. Half seldom or never taught communication partner strategies. Three quarters only used verbal instructions. The main obstacles were environmental factors. Conclusions: This study contributes valuable knowledge about high-tech SGD interventions targeting communication partners. The high-tech SGD intervention may benefit from goal-setting, extended number of training sessions and a range of instructional approaches.Implications for Rehabilitation Speech and language pathologist (SLPs) reported that children with severe cerebral palsy and intellectual disability (SSPI) can benefit from speech generating device (SGD) communication. Communication partner strategies and goal-setting supports the development of communication with SGD. SLPs seldom taught stakeholder communication partner strategies and instruments for goal-setting. Because stakeholders may vary in their way of learning SLPs need to use a variety of instructional approaches. SLPs used few instructional approaches, typically verbal information. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

BCIs are often tested within a single patient population limiting generalization of results. This study focuses on examining individual sensory abilities with an eye toward possible interface adaptations to improve device performance. Methods: Five individuals with a range of neuromotor disorders participated in four-choice BCI control task involving the steady state visually evoked potential. The BCI graphical interface was designed to simulate a commercial AAC device to examine whether an integrated device could be used successfully by individuals with neuromotor impairment. Results: All participants were able to interact with the BCI and highest performance was found for participants able to employ an overt visual attention strategy. For participants with visual deficits to due to impaired oculomotor control, effective performance increased after accounting for mismatches between the graphical layout and participant visual capabilities. Conclusion: As BCIs are translated from research environments to clinical applications, the assessment of BCI-related skills will help facilitate proper device selection and provide individuals who use BCI the greatest likelihood of immediate and long term communicative success. Overall, our results indicate that adaptations can be an effective strategy to reduce barriers and increase access to BCI technology. These efforts should be directed by comprehensive assessments for matching individuals to the most appropriate device to support their complex communication needs.Implications for Rehabilitation Brain computer interfaces using the steady state visually evoked potential can be integrated with an augmentative and alternative communication device to provide access to language and literacy for individuals with neuromotor impairment. Comprehensive assessments are needed to fully understand the sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities of individuals who may use brain-computer interfaces for proper feature matching as selection of the most appropriate device including optimization device layouts and control paradigms. Oculomotor impairments negatively impact brain-computer interfaces that use the steady state visually evoked potential, but modifications to place interface stimuli and communication items in the intact visual field can improve successful outcomes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",AAC; Brain-computer interface (BCI); feature matching; SSVEP; steady-state visually evoked potential,"adult; aged; attention; brain computer interface; brain disease; computer interface; eye movement; female; human; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; sensory feedback; task performance; visual evoked potential; Adult; Aged; Attention; Brain Diseases; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Eye Movements; Feedback, Sensory; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041295278,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,EEG,"ALS, TBI, Cerebral Palsy",5

Most AAC displays are more complex than a single VSD, and also contain a navigation bar. This preliminary study examined visual attention to these more complex AAC displays by participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 13), Down syndrome (n = 13), intellectual and developmental disabilities other than Down syndrome or ASD (n = 9), and preschoolers with typical development (n = 20). Participants viewed images that simulated complex AAC displays containing a main VSD and a navigation bar with thumbnail VSDs arranged in one of four locations (top, bottom, left, or right). Both the main VSD and the navigation bar attracted attention, with participants across groups looking at both elements more than expected based on the space those elements occupied within the display. Within the main VSD, participants spent more time fixating on the meaningful elements (i.e., children and shared activity) compared to the background. Results suggested that gaze patterns to the meaningful elements of the main VSD were influenced by the location of the navigation bar. The finding that bar location may influence visual attention patterns makes it an important AAC system design factor that warrants additional research. © 2019, © 2019 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Augmentative and alternative communication; developmental disabilities; eye tracking; visual scene displays,"Eye tracking; Human rehabilitation engineering; Location; Navigation; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Autism spectrum disorders; Developmental disability; Down syndrome; Hotspots; Typical development; Visual Attention; Visual scene; Behavioral research; adolescent; attention; autism; case control study; child; communication aid; developmental disorder; Down syndrome; female; human; information processing; intellectual impairment; male; oculography; pathophysiology; physiology; preschool child; vision; young adult; Adolescent; Attention; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Communication Aids for Disabled; Data Display; Developmental Disabilities; Down Syndrome; Eye Movement Measurements; Female; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Visual Perception; Young Adult",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069037152,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,Tobii DynaVox T60 ,"ASD, IDD, DS ",55

In the case reported here, the support package improved instructional competence across all team members, which led to small, positive changes in the child’s communication using AAC.

There exists a need to identify effective AAC strategies and tools for individuals experiencing primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a neurodegenerative dementia, for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be systematically evaluated. Aims: To examine the treatment effects of a novel language compensation tool, CoChat, and to determine if lexical retrieval skills improve are maintained during activity retell with use of this AAC application. Methods and procedures: Six individuals with PPA participated. The study was implemented using a single-subject alternating treatments experimental design to compare lexical retrieval during activity retell in three conditions: Absence of technology support, presence of photos only, and presence of CoChat app, with photo and labels. The number of target words produced by the participant during activity retell with a conversation partner was the primary dependent variable. There were two phases of this experiment: Three conditions presented in a fixed-order and three conditions presented in a counterbalanced order. For one participant, an additional implementation of CoChat was piloted at 6- and 9-month post-intervention to examine sustained effect of CoChat during activity retell. Outcomes and results: In the fixed-order phase, results indicated a higher number of target words produced in the CoChat condition for all participants. In the counterbalanced phase, results indicated a higher number of target words in the CoChat condition for two-thirds of the participants. Maintenance probes showed same level of lexical retrieval at 6 and 9 months following intervention. Conclusions: This single-case research design demonstrated that mobile technology compensatory strategies provide necessary support during natural conversations about personally relevant topics for people with PPA. CoChat, a newly developed mobile technology research app that uses social networks and an NLP engine to create a co-constructed external lexicon with visual scene display, significantly increased lexical retrieval during activity retell. Future research should further develop AAC strategies and tools that aid in maintenance of vocabulary access and communication participation for people with PPA over the course of disease progression. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",augmentative and alternative communication; compensatory intervention; mobile technology; natural language processing; Primary progressive aphasia; single case design,adult; aged; Article; clinical article; conversation; experimental design; feedback system; female; human; information retrieval; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; mobile application; natural language processing; primary progressive aphasia; very elderly,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044475427,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"CoChat, iPad",Aphasia ,6

Aims: In this article, we discuss how impairments of executive functioning (EF) might be expected to interact with ability to use AAC effectively. We also review the research literature that has investigated the relationship between EF and response to AAC treatment in aphasia. Assessment tools that may be useful in predicting successful use of AAC by PWA are also discussed. Main Contribution: Results from the few available studies are mixed with respect to the importance of EF to successful AAC use. At present, there is a paucity of research directly investigating which aspects of EF might be the best predictors for response to treatment to learn AAC, although some researchers have reported that EF tasks designed to measure cognitive flexibility (shifting) appear to have some predictive utility. Conclusions: Using terminology from two published models of EF, we suggest that executive attention, which includes working memory, as well as updating, shifting and inhibiting, are all necessary when using AAC for successful communication. This perspective is one that should receive more attention in clinical practice and when designing research on use of AAC by PWA. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",AAC; Aphasia; augmentative and alternative communication; executive function,aphasia; Article; assessment of humans; attentional bias; cerebrovascular accident; clinical assessment tool; clinical practice; cognitive defect; communication aid; conversation; episodic memory; executive function; facilitated communication; human; language ability; language processing; multimodal communication screening task for person with aphasia; nonverbal visual assessment of flexibility in aphasia; problem solving; self monitoring; traumatic brain injury; treatment outcome; working memory,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996486490,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,Aphasia,n/a

In this paper, a novel three-dimensional human-computer interaction application is presented based on augmented reality (AR) technology for assisting children with special problems in communication for social innovation. To begin with, three-dimensional human hand model is constructed to estimate and track the hand’s position of users. An extended particle filter is applied for calculating the pose of background and the positions of children. The likelihoods based on the edge map of the image and pixel color values are utilized to estimate the joint likelihood in three-dimensional model. A flexible real-time hand tracking framework using the ‘golden energy’ scoring function is integrated for capturing region of interests. An inertial tracking technique is used for calculating the quaternion. Three-dimensional models from Google SketchUp are employed. We then use a built QR-code for scanning to access the system, and then utilize for selecting a character three-dimensional designed cartoon by applying the Vidinoti image application. After that, representative three-dimensional cartoons and augmented environments are overlaid, so that it is able to entertain children. A printed coloring photo, called Augmented Flexible Tracking is designed and provided in the system for visualization. The process of the system is done in realtime. Our experiments have revealed that the system is beneficial both quantitatively and qualitatively for assisting children with special needs in communication interactively. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Augmented and mixed reality; Augmented reality; Children with special problems; Communication; Educational games; Human-computer interaction; Three-dimensional interaction,Augmented reality; Communication; Computer games; Image segmentation; Palmprint recognition; Virtual reality; Alternative communication; Augmented reality applications; Children with special problems; Educational game; Extended particle filters; Mixed reality; Three-dimensional interaction; Three-dimensional model; Human computer interaction,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978863615,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,3D AR Education,"AAC users, Children",n/a

We conducted a 3-month study with eight persons with aphasia to better understand how people with aphasia could integrate Amail in their daily life. Subjective data (questionnaires, interviews, and diaries) and objective data (usage logs) were collected to gain understanding of the usage patterns. All persons with aphasia in our study were able to use Amail independently, and four participants continued using Amail after the study period. The usage patterns, especially the frequency and length of the composed email messages, indicated that, over time, persons with aphasia were able to improve their email communication. Email partners also had the impression that their email partners with aphasia were improving gradually. Last but not least, the use of Amail positively influenced the number and quality of social contacts for the persons with aphasia. We also report some of the challenges encountered while conducting the field trial. © 2015 ACM.",Aphasia; Assistive technology; Augmentative and alternative communication; Email; Field evaluation,Human rehabilitation engineering; Surveys; Aphasia; Assistive technology; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Email communication; Field evaluation; Iterative design; Social contacts; Usage patterns; Electronic mail,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948403825,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Amail,Aphasia,8

However, in most cases, complementary quantitative evaluations have not been carried out to confirm those results. To contribute to clarifying the validity of these approaches, our study quantitatively evaluated the effect of using language models with location knowledge on the efficiency of a word and sentence prediction system. Using corpora collected for three different locations (classroom, school cafeteria, home), location-specific language models were trained with sentences from each location and compared with a traditional all-purpose language model, trained on all corpora. User tests showed a modest mean improvement of 2.4% and 1.3% for Words Per Minute (WPM) and Keystroke Saving Rate (KSR), respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant. Since our text prediction system relies on the concept of sentence reuse, we ran a set of simulations with language models having different sentence knowledge levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). We also introduced in the comparison a second location-aware strategy that combines the location-specific approach with the all-purpose approach (mixed approach). The mixed language models performed better under low sentence-reuse conditions (0%, 25%, 50%) with 1.0%, 1.3%, and 1.2% KSR improvements, respectively. The location-specific language models performed better under high sentence-reuse conditions (75%, 100%) with 1.7% and 1.5% KSR improvements, respectively. © 2015 ACM.",Augmentative and alternative communication; Communication rate; Location-awareness; Sentence prediction; Word prediction,Feedback; Forecasting; Human rehabilitation engineering; Location; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communication rate; Location awareness; Prediction systems; Quantitative evaluation; Specific languages; Text prediction system; Word prediction; Computational linguistics,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930809142,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,Location-Aware Text Prediction,AAC users ,24

Method: Target selection tasks were performed using an inductive tongue-computer interface (ITCI). Visual feedback was established by highlighting the area on a visual display corresponding to the activated intra-oral target. Tactile feedback was established using a sensor-border matrix over the sensor plates of the ITCI, which provided sensor-position tactile queues via the user's tongue. Target selection tasks using an on-screen keyboard by controlling the mouse pointer with the ITCI's was also evaluated. Results: Mean target selection rates of 23, 5 and 15 activations per minute were obtained using visual, tactile and ""none"" feedback techniques in the 3rd training session. On-screen keyboard target selection tasks averaged 10 activations per minute in the 3rd training session. Involuntary activations while speaking or drinking were significantly reduced either through a sensor-matrix or dwell time for sensor activation. Conclusions: These results provide key design considerations to further increase the typing efficiency of tongue-computer interfaces for individuals with upper-limb mobility impairments. Implications for Rehabilitation Intra-oral computer interfaces could provide individuals with severe upper-limb mobility impairments the opportunity to control computers and automatic equipment. A fast and efficient sensory feedback is vital for a good performance of an intra-oral computer interface. Reduction of involuntary activations due to talking and drinking will improve the acceptability of intra-oral interfaces. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Assistive technology; Augmentative and alternative communication; Computer interface; Sensory feedback,"adult; article; communication aid; computer interface; disabled person; human; sensory feedback; tongue; Adult; Communication Aids for Disabled; Disabled Persons; Feedback, Sensory; Humans; Tongue; User-Computer Interface",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878933243,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,Intra-oral target,Motor disabilities,20

With adapted interfaces, Lego robots provide children with disabilities a way of manipulating objects, creating opportunities for play and learning, thus promoting their cognitive development. However, children need to learn how to control the robot before being able to use it as a tool to perform educational tasks. Objective: This paper describes a training protocol to control Lego robots via Speech Generating Devices (SGDs). Playful tasks of increasing complexity and appropriate metrics were designed such that the child progressively develops basic robot control skills, learns how to use the robot to manipulate items, and finally is able to use the SGD both for controlling the robot and for communication, switching between robot and communication modes. The protocol is used to bring participants to an adequate competency level for a larger study using Lego robots to perform math measurement activities. Main content: The protocol is described including a familiarization session, trials doing a slalom course, and then a final operational accuracy test. Three children with cerebral palsy performed the protocol. Results: Results of the application of the training protocol show that it provides an adequate method to incrementally develop children's abilities to use the robot as a tool to perform educational math measurement tasks. Conclusions: Introducing domains (robot control, manipulation, communication) one at a time during the training protocol provided an opportunity for the participants to practice skills that they need for math measurement activities. This protocol also provided an opportunity for the investigators to evaluate the effect of adding manipulation and communication demands on top of robot control. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

In addition, hemiplegia of the dominant side of the body, which frequently accompanies aphasia, can limit use of a writing implement, keyboard, or mouse. These factors make it difficult for individuals with aphasia to create text. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) could address this need. However, ASR accuracy for aphasic speech is limited. Work on decoupling speech production from real-time constraints has shown that some individuals with aphasia can improve the quality of their speech by using a ""processing prosthesis,"" software that allows users to record speech fragments and build them into larger structures by manipulating visual icons. This paper describes a study assessing the efficacy of combining the prosthesis with ASR. ASR accuracy was compared for speech samples created with and without the prosthesis by four individuals with aphasia; for three participants, ASR was markedly more accurate for utterances created with the prosthesis. While the support of the prosthesis alone does not increase ASR accuracy enough to support general dictation applications for users with aphasia, it suggests that offline support along with measures such as training and vocabulary restriction may eventually enable individuals with aphasia to use ASR for everyday tasks. © 2008 IOS Press.

These systems can employ a variety of techniques to organize stored words, phrases, and sentences, and to make them available to the user. It is argued in this chapter that an AAC system should make better use of the regularities in an individual's conversational experiences and the expectations that the individual normally brings into a conversational context. An interface and methodology are described for organizing and retrieving sentences appropriate to a particular conversational context, sentences that were possibly developed from earlier conversations. These conversations are represented according to the schema structures discussed by Schank as a model for memory and cognitive organization [16]. The interface allows the user to proceed with minimal effort through conversations that follow the schema closely, and facilitates the derivation of new schemata when the conversation diverges from existing ones. This interface, called SchemaTalk, is intended to operate in parallel with and to complement a user's existing augmentative communication system. The results of preliminary investigations into the effectiveness of the interface and methodology have been encouraging; further investigations are planned. Of interest for future study is how the use of schematized text might influence the way that augmented communicators are perceived by their conversational partners. Possible design modifications to improve the usability of the interface are also under investigation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.",,Human rehabilitation engineering; Natural language processing systems; User interfaces; AAC systems; Augmentative communication; Augmentative communication system; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Cognitive organization; Design modifications; Motor impairments; Speech communication,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-2342496173,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,SchemaTalk,AAC users ,2

Dynamic assessment was integrated into a single-case multi-element design. The researchers examined the effects of three different display formats that varied in (a) array size, and (b) the number of steps needed to make a response, on the average levels of support needed to make item requests and action/social word responses. Three participants demonstrated high levels of independence when requesting items with displays that utilized small arrays and did not require navigation. These participants also showed rapid increases in their ability to make item requests with displays that required two-step navigation, and began to use action and social words across displays with decreasing levels of support. In comparison, the three remaining participants did not demonstrate consistent independence with any display or communicative function, but did show differences in levels of supports (e.g., overall less support needed for less complex displays and for item requests in comparison to action and social words).

This may reduce the need for extraneous face-to-face intervention within social and educational settings and thereby preserve the naturalness of interactions for individuals with ASD. In this article, the following questions are explored: (1) Will some children with ASD with limited functional speech tolerate wearing a smartwatch after receiving only spoken instructions? (2) Can children with ASD who did not initially tolerate wearing a smartwatch increase their tolerance for wearing a smartwatch after they view video models within a visual schedule? and (3) Will children with ASD who tolerate wearing a smartwatch attend to, and follow, scene cue text messages received on the watch?

The majority of adult individuals with severe disabilities in our study have prior experiences with using various AAC devices, yet a high rate of abandonment is noted. Under such circumstances and in order to support more effective design and increased use of AAC, it is important to look beyond the interaction with dedicated AAC devices, and gain a better understanding of AAC use, practices and care support. In a sixmonth study that comprised participating in speech therapy sessions and working together with families, support workers and adults with severe disabilities, we lay out the foundations for a design framework that needs to consider a) current AAC cultural status b) modelling of AAC use c) creation of AAC user-friendly environments and d) personalization of AAC dedicated devices and the potential for AAC tangible (mid-Tech) alternatives.

Participants in AC-I, when compared to those in the other two interventions, had a significantly stronger relationship between initial receptive language and post-intervention expressive language age. For expressive target vocabulary size, participants in AC-O showed a strong relationship and those in AC-I a slightly weaker relationship between initial receptive language and expressive target vocabulary size; no significant relationship was found in the SC group.

The advent of conductive fabrics presents an opportunity to render SGDs wearable, thus persistently available. Our goal was to design and test a wearable SGD incorporating resistive textile-based switches for a nonverbal pediatric participant with vision impairment. Materials and methods: Quad-key fabric keypads were designed using two conductive fabrics in combination with felt and mesh insulators. The keypad with the most repeatable low force activations and the least cross-talk among keys was chosen for implementation in a wrist-worn, four-message textile SGD. The fabric-based SGD was used by a nonverbal pediatric participant for two one-week analysis periods, alternating with the user’s current device for usage reference. Data were derived from usage logs, parent questionnaires and an end-of-study participant interview. Results: The best performing keypad consisted of two layers of woven conductive fabrics and one layer of insulating felt with 10 mm apertures. Communicative interactions were higher with the fabric-based SGD, particularly at school. Unprompted initiation of communication was observed only with the fabric-based SGD. The persistent availability of the textile solution, along with esthetic appeal likely contributed to its utilization. While the participant preferred the fabric-based SGD, the parent opted for the iPod alternative, citing enhanced message intelligibility. Conclusions: Fabric-based SGDs are a new alternative to conventional SGD designs using rigid electronics. As such, tactile differentiability of keys, device wearability and esthetic personalization may be promising advantages for pediatric users.Implications for rehabilitation Fabric-based switches may be a promising alternative to conventional electro-mechanical switches for the control of speech-generating devices, offering functional (e.g., comfort and tactile differentiability), expressive (e.g., non-stigmatizing textile integration) and esthetic (e.g., colors and textures) appeal. The material combination of two layers of woven conductive material and one insulating layer of felt with 10 mm diameter apertures seems to provide a fabric-based keypad suitable for pediatric use, requiring low-force activation and minimal cross-talk among buttons. Fabric-based devices offer advantages of tactile differentiability and thus may be particularly suited to individuals with vision impairments. Wearable textile SGDs can be persistently available and may thus increase opportunities for communication. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",assistive technology; augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); electronic textile; fabric-based switch; Speech generating device (SGD); wearable technology,adolescent; communication aid; electronic device; equipment design; female; handicapped child; human; questionnaire; rehabilitation; textile; Adolescent; Communication Aids for Disabled; Disabled Children; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; Textiles; Wearable Electronic Devices,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047438569,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Fabric SGD, iPod touch, TalkTrac",TBI,1

Methods: Initial assessment at four years of age revealed that the patient had rudimentary communication skills, with significant sensory integration dysfunction manifested as oral, olfactory, and tactile seeking behaviours; self-stimulatory behaviour; and complete dependence on caregiver for activities of daily living. Intensive, multi-disciplinary intervention resulted in minimal improvement in communicative skills and sensory seeking over six months. Subsequently, a tailor-made picture-assisted communication training with the mother as the communication facilitator was adopted. This approach was abandoned due to the patient’s poor response and mother’s low acceptance of picture-based interaction. A preference for printed material was observed in the patient. Accordingly, further management was focused on employing a computer-based interactive platform that the patient was taught to use over the course of a few months as a part of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention program. This resulted in a remarkable improvement in the child’s skills that now allowed for a better intentional communication of his thoughts and needs. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of revisiting conventional rehabilitation strategies for communicative deficits and tailoring them according to the patient’s needs and preferences. It also emphasises that besides excellent observation skills, clinicians must be willing to consider technology based approaches in patients responding poorly to traditional approaches in order to develop effective interventional programmes.Implication for Rehabilitation The current study highlights the importance of exploring the application of technology based intervention for building communication skills in the early stages of rehabilitation for persons with communicative deficit. It also emphasises the need for excellent observation skills among clinicians so that the peculiar interests of children with ASD may be applied in designing training programmes to overcome communication barriers. Additionally, clinicians should familiarise themselves with the latest assistive technology-based rehabilitation approaches and be willing to explore newer approaches if traditional ones fail to yield satisfactory outcomes. Use of technology-based interventions to reduce dependence among persons with disability would be beneficial, both socially and economically, in developing countries with limited resources. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",augmentative and alternative communication; autism spectrum disorder; communication; intervention; reading and writing; Technology,"autism; case report; communication aid; human; India; male; pathophysiology; preschool child; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child, Preschool; Communication Aids for Disabled; Humans; India; Male",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049651536,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,"iOS, Avaz","Autism, Children",1

Results indicated that differential processing and effort was required when interpreting the two display types. Both groups of participants required significantly more visual fixation time and exhibited patterns consistent with greater cognitive effort when identifying themes depicted in grids compared to visual scenes (i.e., greater numbers of short fixations). The participants with TBI were overall less efficient than those without TBI when identifying themes presented in both AAC display types. These results add to the growing body of evidence indicating that visual scenes may more effectively represent complex concepts than decontextualized, grid-based images for individuals with TBI. Additional clinical implications are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",attention; Eye-tracking; gist reasoning; working memory,"Brain; Eye tracking; Human rehabilitation engineering; attention; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Cognitive efforts; Eye tracking technologies; Functional communication; gist reasoning; Traumatic Brain Injuries; Working memory; Image processing; adult; aged; attention; case control study; communication aid; communication disorder; dysarthria; female; human; information processing; male; middle aged; oculography; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; short term memory; traumatic brain injury; vision; young adult; Adult; Aged; Attention; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Case-Control Studies; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Disorders; Data Display; Dysarthria; Eye Movement Measurements; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Middle Aged; Photic Stimulation; Visual Perception; Young Adult",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068528088,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,Tobii T60,TBI ,26

This study was a follow-up to a previous study. Method Three students with cerebral palsy used the robot to measure objects using non-standard units, such as straws, and then compared and ordered the objects using the resulting measurement. Their performance was assessed, and the manipulation and communication events were observed. Teachers and education assistants were interviewed regarding robot use. Results Similar benefits to the previous study were found in this study. Gaps in student procedural knowledge were identified such as knowing to place measurement units tip-to-tip, and students’ reporting revealed gaps in conceptual understanding. However, performance improved with repeated practice. Stakeholders identified that some robot tasks took too long or were too difficult to perform. Conclusions Having access to both their SGD and a robot gave the students multiple ways to show their understanding of the measurement concepts. Though they could participate actively in the new mathematics activities, robot use is most appropriate in short tasks requiring reasonable operational skill.Implications for Rehabilitation Lego robots controlled via speech-generating devices (SGDs) can help students to engage in the mathematics pedagogy of performing hands-on activities while communicating about concepts. Students can “show what they know” using the Lego robots, and report and reflect on concepts using the SGD. Level 1 and Level 2 mathematics measurement activities have been adapted to be accomplished by the Lego robot. Other activities can likely be accomplished with similar robot adaptations (e.g., gripper, pen). It is not recommended to use the robot to measure items that are long, or perform measurements that require high operational competence in order to be successful. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Augmentative and alternative communication; children with physical disabilities; Lego robots; mathematics skills; speech-generating devices,adolescent; cerebral palsy; child; communication aid; computer interface; devices; female; handicapped child; human; male; mathematics; robotics; speech; Adolescent; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Communication Aids for Disabled; Disabled Children; Female; Humans; Male; Mathematics; Robotics; Speech; User-Computer Interface,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961214566,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Vanguard II SGD,"Children, Cerebral Palsy",3

Supporting young children who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to develop their understanding and use of basic concepts is an area of practice that has important ramifications for successful communication in a classroom environment. This study examined the availability of basic concept words across eight frequently used, commercially available AAC language systems, iPad© applications, and symbol libraries used to create communication boards. The accessibility of basic concept words was subsequently examined using two AAC language page sets and two iPad applications. Results reveal that the availability of basic concept words represented within the different AAC language programs, iPad applications, and symbol libraries varied but was limited across programs. However, there is no significant difference in the accessibility of basic concept words across the language program page sets or iPad applications, generally because all of them require sophisticated motor and cognitive plans for access. These results suggest that educators who teach or program vocabulary in AAC systems need to be mindful of the importance of basic concept words in classroom settings and, when possible, enhance the availability and accessibility of these words to users of AAC. © 2017 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",augmentative and alternative communication; basic concept vocabulary; Vocabulary,"Hand held computers; Human rehabilitation engineering; Libraries; Teaching; Transportation; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Basic concepts; Classroom environment; Classroom settings; Communication board; iPad applications; Vocabulary; Vocabulary lists; Application programs; human; human experiment; library; linguistics; software; child; communication aid; mobile application; personal digital assistant; vocabulary; Child; Communication Aids for Disabled; Computers, Handheld; Humans; Mobile Applications; Software; Vocabulary",Note,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020628945,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Compass, Gateway, InterAACt, Unity, iPad, Proloquo2Go, Sono Flex, Boardmaker, SymbolStix",AAC users,n/a

One issue that has come to light in recent years is the fact that selecting personalized VSDs, which depict the person with complex communication needs or an individual with whom they are familiar, is preferred over generic VSDs, which depict unfamiliar individuals. Although personalization is likely an important factor in the usability of VSDs, these images may be difficult for clinicians to obtain. As such, compromises must be identified. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of controlling personal relevance factors (i.e., age and gender of the people depicted in generic VSDs) on the image preference patterns of adults with and without aphasia. Results from three very preliminary study summaries indicate that gender and age are both mitigating factors in image preference, as males tended to indicate preference for VSDs containing males over those containing females. In addition, females tended to indicate preference for females of a similar age depicted in VSDs. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Graphic symbols are used to help support understanding of language and used in symbol communication aids to support expressive communication. The decision making related to the selection of a symbol communication aid for a child is poorly understood and little is known about what language and communication attributes are considered in this selection. Aim: To identify from the literature the language or communication attributes of graphic symbol communication aids that currently influence AAC practice. Method and Procedure: A search strategy was developed and searches were performed on a range of electronic databases for papers published since 1970. Quality appraisal was carried out using the CCAT tool and papers rated as weak were not included in the review. Results: Eleven studies were included in the review reporting data from 66 participants. Weaknesses were identified in most studies that would limit the validity of the results for application to practice. Included studies investigated aspects of vocabulary organization and design, the process of vocabulary selection, and the choice of the symbol system and encoding method. Two studies also evaluated innovative communication aid attributes. Conclusions: Information from studies reported in the research literature provides a sparse source of information about symbol communication aids from which clinicians, children or family members may make informed decisions.Implications for Rehabilitation This review is the first to systematically appraise the literature to answer the question what evidence exists to inform clinical decision making in relation to the language or communication attributes of graphic symbol based communication aids? The review establishes that there is a paucity of evidence from studies and that these decisions must thus be based on other information and factors. The review does establish a small number of language or communication attributes of symbol communication aids, but no synthesis of the results of these studies was possible. This review thus suggests that vocabulary design and organization, symbol system and encoding method, and the choice of vocabulary selection method are attributes that clinicians may carefully review in order to inform decisions. Clinicians encountering symbol vocabulary packages claiming to be ‘evidence based’ should query the nature of this evidence. The rehabilitation research community should debate and develop appropriate research designs that will facilitate future robust studies investigating the effect of specific language or communication attributes of communication aids. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",AAC; augmentative and alternative communication aids; communication aids; graphic symbols,child; clinical decision making; communication aid; handicapped child; human; language; rehabilitation; Child; Clinical Decision-Making; Communication Aids for Disabled; Disabled Children; Humans; Language,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088363499,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,AAC users ,n/a

This paper proposes a design engineering approach for quantitatively exploring context-aware sentence retrieval as a promising complementary input interface, working in tandem with a word-prediction keyboard. We motivate the need for complementary design engineering methodology in the design of augmentative and alternative communication and explain how such methods can be used to gain additional design insights. We then study the theoretical performance envelopes of a context-aware sentence retrieval system, identifying potential keystroke savings as a function of the parameters of the subsystems, such as the accuracy of the underlying auto-complete word prediction algorithm and the accuracy of sensed context information under varying assumptions. We find that context-aware sentence retrieval has the potential to provide users with considerable improvements in keystroke savings under reasonable parameter assumptions of the underlying subsystems. This highlights how complementary design engineering methods can reveal additional insights into design for augmentative and alternative communication. © 2020 ACM.",augmentative and alternative communication; context-aware text entry; design engineering; information retrieval; sentence prediction; text entry,Design; Human engineering; Human rehabilitation engineering; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communication rate; Complementary designs; Context information; Design Engineering; Keystroke savings; Retrieval systems; Theoretical performance; Search engines,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091298226,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Context-Aware Sentence Retrieval,Motor disabilities ,n/a

In this work, we recast and broaden this prior work using conversational agency as a new frame to study AC communication. We investigate AC conversational agency with a study examining different conversational tasks between four triads of expert ACs, their close conversation partners (paid aide or parent), and a third party (experimenter).

We address this by extracting design requirements for a clinical AAC tablet application from n=10 adults with mild ID. Our results show that such technologies can promote communication between general practitioners (GPs) and patients with mild ID by extracting symptoms in advance of the consultation via an accessible questionnaire. These symptoms act as a referent and assist in raising the awareness of conditions commonly overlooked by GPs. Furthermore, the application can support people with ID in identifying and accessing healthcare services.

The current study used conversational analysis techniques to examine naturalistic face-To-face interaction between a man with late-stage ALS and his wife to understand the types of accommodations they made to ensure that successful meaning was established. Three extracts of talk were selected from a corpus of 30 videotaped interactions between a man with ALS interacting either with his wife or the first author of the study. The extracts were examined for the type of communicative resources used and the ways in which conversants worked together to maintain the temporal-sequential demands of in-person interaction. Conversants used a variety of communication modalities during their social interactions including voice, body, gestures, a speech-generating device (SGD), and the SGD screen to construct utterances for one another, establish meaning, and stay in-Time. The pair were successful and maintained conversation expectations in many ways similar to those with nonimpaired voices and bodies. Conversations including an SGD are a highly coordinated and interactive affair that is experienced jointly by all conversants.

However, as with all adolescents, they have personal goals and should have equal access to participation across facets of life including but not limited to education. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technologies can support individuals with IDD and limited speech in achieving those goals and experiencing greater participation more like their peers without disabilities in adolescence. Augmentative and alternative communication technologies can be applied in intervention with 2 distinct but complementary guiding priorities. First, technology can be applied to compensate for limitations in language form, content, and/or use to support immediate participation in adolescent pursuits for individuals with IDD. Second, technology can be used as a tool to build skills in language form, content, and/or use that have long-Term implications for participation and success in adolescence and adulthood. This article outlines applications of AAC technologies within those guiding priorities. In addition, the article outlines case examples in which adolescents with IDD and limited speech have benefited from AAC technologies to compensate for linguistic difficulties and build their language and communication skills. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Approximately half of those on the autism spectrum are functionally non-verbal or minimally verbal and will not develop sufficient natural speech or writing to meet their daily communication needs. A suite of evidence-based mobile applications, SPEAKall!® and SPEAKmore!®, was developed to help these individuals achieve critical speech and language milestones. SPEAKall! and SPEAKmore! enable early language learning, facilitate natural speech development, enhance generalization skills, and expand social circles as students learn. These solutions grow with the learner, enabling better participation in school and community, thus reducing the lifetime cost of care while enhancing chances for classroom success. Evidence generation for the newly created applications involved: (a) Single-subject experimental designs to evaluate treatment efficacy through repeated measurement of behavior and replication across and within participants; (b) quantitative electroencephalograms to gain information about brain functioning. The comprehensive approach to evidence-generation facilitated adoption of SPEAKall! and SPEAKmore! in clinical practice. It also allowed identifying critical app features that enhance skill acquisition and contribute to treatment effectiveness. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Augmentative and alternative communication; Autism spectrum disorders; Mobile technology,Bioelectric phenomena; Diseases; Human rehabilitation engineering; Mobile computing; Plasma diagnostics; Speech communication; Students; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Autism spectrum disorders; Clinical practices; Design and evaluations; Mobile applications; Mobile Technology; Quantitative electroencephalograms; Repeated measurements; Human computer interaction,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069714507,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"SpeakKall, SpeakMore","Autism, Children",3

The aim of this study was to explore the potential of the Family Impact of Assistive Technology Scale for AAC (FIATS-AAC) to detect functional change in children and youth with AAC needs, aged 3–17 years, and their families, 6 and 12 weeks after receiving a graphic-based, speech-generating device (SGD). Parents whose children were awaiting a SGD as part of their regular AAC service participated in the study. In all, 45 parents completed the FIATS-AAC during each of three phone interviews: at the time of device delivery, and then 6 weeks and 12 weeks after receiving the device. Children and youth were aged 3–16 years (M = 7.8, SD = 3.3) and were mostly context-dependent communicators. Paired t-tests indicated statistically significant gains in functioning from baseline to both 6 and 12 weeks after receiving the AAC device. Effect sizes were 0.41 and 0.38, respectively.

In the area of communication, for example, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) via switch scanning may be an optimally viable option for children with significant physical limitations. However, children's acquisition of switch scanning may be hampered by the dearth of evidence-based training protocols and the cognitively demanding nature of the task, diminishing motivation. Introducing AAC scanning skills may be facilitated by incorporating switch-controlled robots. Robot mediated play tasks can be designed such that specific switch scanning skills are trained in a potentially engaging setup. This paper reports the technical developments of physical and software-driven virtual robots controlled using switches to perform different play activities. A robot mediated switch training protocol informed by end-user trials is also reported. © 2013 The authors and IOS Press.

Motor disorders can also affect the ability to produce clear speech and to communicate. The aim of this study was to develop and to test a prototype of an assistive tool with an embedded mobile communication device to support patients with severe speech impairments. Methods: A prototype was developed by equipping a cycling jacket with a display, a small keyboard, a LED and an alarm system, all controlled by a microcontroller. Functionality of the prototype was tested in six participants (aged 7–20 years) with cerebral palsy and global developmental disorder and three healthy persons. A patient questionnaire consisting of seven items was used as an evaluation tool. Results: A working prototype of the communication jacket was developed and tested. The questionnaire elicited positive responses from participants. Improvements to correct revealed weaknesses were proposed. Enhancements like voice output of pre-selected phrases and enlarged display were implemented. Conclusions: Integration in a jacket makes the system mobile and continuously available to the user. The communication jacket may be of great benefit to patients with motor and speech impairments.Implications for Rehabilitation The communication jacket developed can be easily used by people with movement and speech impairment. All technical components are integrated in a garment and do not have to be held with the hands or transported separately. The system is adaptable to individual use. Both expected and unexpected events can be dealt with, which contributes to the quality of life and self-fulfilment. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Assistive technology; cerebral palsy; communication device; disability; speech impairment,adolescent; cerebral palsy; child; clothing; communication aid; computer interface; female; human; male; patient satisfaction; power supply; quality of life; speech disorder; young adult; Adolescent; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Clothing; Communication Aids for Disabled; Electric Power Supplies; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Speech Disorders; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018188243,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Mobile communication jacket ,Cerebral palsy,6

To satisfy their complex communication needs, a variety of AAC systems have been developed as mobile applications (apps). The effectiveness of these apps mainly relies on the abilities of communication peers. Persuasive technology is aimed at changing behaviors and attitudes. In order to increase the frequency of presenting visual aids with verbal messages, we applied persuasive principles in designing the mobile AAC app named “STalk2.” The app is capable of recognizing voice and presenting visual aids stored in a local database and/or retrieved by image search on the web; it also monitors communication activities. In this study, we examined the effects of using STalk2 on the behaviors and attitudes of five children with CCN and eleven of their peers. Special attention was paid to analyzing questionnaires, diaries, and video recordings obtained from peers. The results suggest that persuasive technology in AAC systems may be effective in improving communication behaviors and attitudes. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Adaptive and augmented interaction; Augmentative and alternative communication; Complex communication needs; Design for quality of life technologies; Persuasive technology,Human rehabilitation engineering; Surveys; Video recording; Adaptive and augmented interaction; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Complex communication needs; Design for qualities; Persuasive technology; Human computer interaction,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050591089,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"STalk2, App",Children,5

Emilys teacher and assistive technology (AT) team thought that controlling a robot would motivate Emily to ""use her SGD more"". Method: A descriptive case study was used because the integration of communication and manipulation technologies is not yet understood. Target activities and goals were chosen by Emilys teacher and AT team. Emily performed several manipulative math activities and engaged in an ""acting"" activity aimed at increasing her message length. The competency skills needed to control a robot from the SGD were examined, as well as stakeholder satisfaction with the robot system. Results: Emily generated up to 0.4 communication events and 7 robot commands per minute in the activities. Her length of utterance was usually one-word long, but she generated two- and three-word utterances during some activities. Observations of Emily informed a framework to describe the competency skills needed to use SGDs to control robots. Emily and her teacher expressed satisfaction with robot use. Conclusion: Robot use could motivate students to build SGD operational skills and learn educational concepts.Implications for RehabilitationControlling a robot from a speech-generating device (SGD) could increase students motivation, engagement and understanding in learning educational concepts, because of the hands-on enactive approach.The robot and SGD system was acceptable to the participant and teacher and elicited positive comments from classmates. Thus, it may provide a way for children with disabilities to link with the curriculum and with other students in the classroom.Controlling a robot via SGD presents opportunities to improve augmentative and alternative communication operational, linguistic, social and strategic skills.Careful choice of activities will ensure that the activity requirements focus on the desired target skill, e.g. drawing or playing board games could be helpful to build operational skills and acting out stories could be helpful for building linguistic skills. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",Assistive robots; Augmentative and alternative communication; Complex communication needs; Educational activities; Mathematics; Object manipulation; Speech-generating device,case report; cerebral palsy; child; communication aid; female; handicapped child; human; robotics; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Communication Aids for Disabled; Disabled Children; Female; Humans; Robotics,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962788279,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Vanguard II SGD, Unity 45, Lego Robot","Cerebral palsy, Children",1

We deployed a unified approach to analyse a child's movements, fusing caregiver and clinician observations with quantitative data (accelerations of the upper extremities). Two case studies were examined. In both, the accelerometer data identified preference at adjusted accuracies statistically above chance using a linear discriminant classifier. Visually, communicative movement patterns were identified in the first child (κ=0.25-0.27) but not in the second child (κ=0.03-0.11). Implications of this study include possible enhancement in communication and independence for these children. © 2011 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Accelerometer; Communication; Hyperkinetic movement; Observational analysis; Paediatric,"Accelerometers; Communication; Human rehabilitation engineering; Accelerometer data; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communication solutions; Communicative intent; Hyperkinetic movement; Integrated approach; Linear discriminant classifier; Observational analysis; Pediatrics; article; auditory rehabilitation; behavior; biomechanics; case report; cerebral palsy; child; communication aid; decision making; gesture; human; hyperkinesia; male; motor activity; nonverbal communication; preschool child; psychological aspect; signal processing; verbal behavior; videorecording; Biomechanics; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Child, Preschool; Choice Behavior; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Methods, Total; Gestures; Humans; Hyperkinesis; Intention; Male; Motor Activity; Nonverbal Communication; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Verbal Behavior; Video Recording",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054849100,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,"Cerebral Palsy, HKM, Children",2

It is possible that the use of icon prediction may facilitate learning in such systems by providing additional visual cues. The goal of the current study was to determine the effect of using icon prediction on the performance of 5-year-old children with typical development who were learning to locate and generalize vocabulary prestored in AAC technologies using iconic encoding. Twenty 5-year-old children were introduced to 30 vocabulary items and asked to locate them using iconic encoding during four learning and testing sessions. Ten of the children completed this task without iconic prediction, and 10 completed the task with icon prediction. They were also asked to locate an additional 30 vocabulary items, not previously introduced, during one generalization session. The results indicated that the children in the icon prediction group did not perform more accurately than the children who did not have prediction available. There was some evidence, however, that using icon prediction may help to facilitate generalization of the use of iconic encoding to novel vocabulary.

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention can provide important supports for persons with these complex communication needs but must be customized to address the goals, strengths, and needs of the individual. This article provides a description of a personalized AAC intervention for a young adult with DS whose speech was frequently unintelligible. The AAC intervention made use of a video visual scene display (VSD) approach and was investigated in 2 separate studies in 2 key community settings: An inclusive post-secondary education program (a single-case reversal ABAB design), and a community shopping activity (a nonexperimental AB case study design). The participant demonstrated sharp increases in successful communication and participation in both settings following the introduction of the video VSD, and both the participant and the key stakeholders viewed the intervention positively. The results provide preliminary evidence that personalized AAC intervention, including the use of a video VSD approach, can provide important supports for communication and participation in community settings for adults with DS and complex communication needs. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

They also report negative experiences interacting with health care providers during these encounters, placing them at risk for preventable adverse medical events, poor quality of life, and dependence on others. Fortunately, providers and people with communication disabilities can take steps to improve these interactions by personalizing and implementing communication supports to empower people with communication disabilities to actively participate in these interactions and improve outcomes. The purpose of this article is to describe strategies that health care providers can use to develop and implement personalized communication supports for children and adults with communication disorders during health care interactions. Additional strategies are provided to guide people with disabilities as well as their community/school providers and families to prepare for health care interactions. Case examples are provided to illustrate use of these strategies in acute care, inpatient rehabilitation, and outpatient settings.

Drawing on situated theories of cognition and communication, SDA aims to understand real-time communicative processes of people engaging in complex sociocultural activities in specific sociomaterial environments. For SDA, discourse points first to the multimodal processes, not the products, of communicative interactions people engage in, and recognizes that these processes are fundamentally complex, distributed, and emergent. The article begins by defining SDA and describing four theoretical principles that guide this approach. We illustrate ways SDA might alter and advance theory, research, and clinical practice by considering its application to understanding the use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technologies by adults with neurogenic communication disorders and their routine partners. We then explore empirical evidence from a methodologically diverse set of cases. The first considers Mialet's (2012) ethnographic study of Stephen Hawking and his use of AAC technologies, which highlights the complex, distributed, and emergent nature of situated discourse. We turn then to our clinical experiences, reflecting on what we have learned from our clients who have creatively repurposed technologies to remediate their activities and to mediate successful interactions and situated learning. Finally, we discuss a participatory design research project that used SDA as a guide for the innovative design of PIMs, pseudo-intelligent mediators (i.e., devices that sense the environment and act as active agents to mediate interactions). We conclude the article with a discussion of ways SDA contributes to and advances our research and clinical practice. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Computing systems have been developed to support AAC; however, partially due to technical problems, poor interface, and limited interaction functions, AAC systems are not widespread, adopted, and used, therefore reaching a limited audience. This article proposes a methodology to support AAC for people with motor impairments, using computer vision and machine learning techniques to allow for personalized gestural interaction. The methodology was applied in a pilot system used by both volunteers without disabilities, and by volunteers with motor and speech impairments, to create datasets with personalized gestures. The created datasets and a public dataset were used to evaluate the technologies employed for gesture recognition, namely the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (using Transfer Learning), and for motion representation, namely the conventional Motion History Image and Optical Flow-Motion History Image (OF-MHI). Results obtained from the estimation of prediction error using K-fold cross-validation suggest SVM associated with OF-MHI presents slightly better results for gesture recognition. Results indicate the technical feasibility of the proposed methodology, which uses a low-cost approach, and reveals the challenges and specific needs observed during the experiment with the target audience. © 2020 ACM.",accessibility; Assistive technology; augmentative and alternative communication; computer vision; gesture recognition,Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Gesture recognition; Human rehabilitation engineering; Optical flows; Speech communication; Support vector machines; Transfer learning; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Expression difficulties; Gestural interaction; Interaction functions; K fold cross validations; Machine learning techniques; Motion history images; Motion representation; Learning systems,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096595438,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,PGCA,Motor disabilities ,6

In order to overcome these challenges and to enhance communication abilities, Augmentative Alternative Communication (AAC) can be introduced in intervention. This single case study reports the improvements in communication skills when the child made a transition from a communication book to an iPad speech generating app. Participant was a 7 year old child with multiple disability and CCN who was undergoing intervention using communication book and transited to an AAC app namely AVAZ. A comparison of pre and post-therapy communicative function was carried out using tool Communication Matrix to understand the improvement. When the child made transition from a communication book to a iPad speech generating AAC app, significant improvement was observed in all communicative functions namely refusal, obtaining, social purpose and for gathering information. After a total of 10 training sessions, the child advanced from level of using concrete symbols to a level of “Language” i.e. using a combination of abstract symbols for communication. This case report indicated that transition to an iPad AAC app had significant benefits on improving communication skills which in turn had positive impact on linguistic and literacy skills. Consequently, an improvement in levels of motivation and confidence was noted. Hence, providing access to the appropriate AAC device/technology in ongoing intervention is the foundation to building effective communication skills.

For AAC-aided communication to be successful, caregivers should support children with consistent intervention strategies in various settings. As such, caregivers need to continuously observe and discuss children's AAC usage to create a shared understanding of these strategies. However, caregivers often find it challenging to effectively collaborate with one another due to a lack of family involvement and the unstructured process of collaboration. To address these issues, we present TalkingBoogie, which consists of two mobile apps: TalkingBoogie-AAC for caregiver-child communication, and TalkingBoogie-coach supporting caregiver collaboration. Working together, these applications provide contextualized layouts for symbol arrangement, scaffold the process of sharing and discussing observations, and induce caregivers' balanced participation. A two-week deployment study with four groups (N=11) found that TalkingBoogie helped increase mutual understanding of strategies and encourage balanced participation between caregivers with reduced cognitive loads. © 2020 ACM.",aac; accessibility; assistive technology; caregiver collaboration; developmental disability,Human rehabilitation engineering; Scaffolds; Aided communication; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Cognitive loads; Developmental disability; Intervention strategy; Mobile apps; Mutual understanding; Shared understanding; Human engineering,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091297830,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,"TalkingBoogie, App, iOS","Developmental difficulties, Children  ",4

Communication strategies and scaffolds, specifically through augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), offer vital compensatory support for persons with dementia in an attempt to maintain the latter's quality of life and well-being through participation with others. To date, no research review has been published that synthesizes the current research of AAC in the field of dementia. Aims: To provide an overview of current AAC strategies and techniques used for supporting communication in dementia by surveying the literature base in a systematic manner, synthesizing the findings and highlighting trends and gaps. Methods & Procedures: A multifaceted search strategy included nine electronic database searches, using specific keywords. Application of predefined selection criteria during screening procedures led to the inclusion of 39 studies. Data were extracted and studies synthesized according to communication partners; description of AAC strategies and techniques; outcome measures; and communication outcomes. Main Contribution: This review shows that the majority of the research to date has focused on supporting the interactions of persons with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) using non-electronic memory and communication aids. Future research should focus on social participation and person-centred communication to optimize functional communication with AAC. Training programmes targeting dyadic interaction and supporting persons with dementia from diverse ethnic backgrounds are avenues for further research. Conclusions: Research trends and, more importantly, the gaps highlighted in this research review present speech–language therapists and researchers with a set of current priorities that are necessary for the advancement of the knowledge base. © 2019 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists",AAC; communication; dementia; interaction; research review,"Alzheimer disease; communication aid; communication disorder; human; human relation; procedures; psychology; Alzheimer Disease; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Disorders; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Outcome Assessment, Health Care",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069681884,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,Dementia,n/a

Children with CCN who utilize high-Tech AAC options at an early age are essentially growing up with a technology that is inserted into interactions across multiple contexts for communication. An aided system can potentially create additional demands, serve a complementary role, or even be a platform to create a collaborative space for social interaction. This article discusses the impact of technology on contexts for communication and presents a progression from unaided AAC strategies to the use of aided systems for fostering expressive language skills and supporting participation.

Using a line drawn scene of a living room, a traditional traveling cursor (a green outline of objects within the scene) was compared with sequential animation—logically matching the function of items in the scene (e.g., hands of a clock moving, a lamp turning on and off, etc.). After three learning sessions, only the matched function animation condition revealed a significant increase in accuracy scores from session 1 to session 3. Age-related trends suggested the mean scores in the cursor-based condition were associated with older children consistently performing at high levels and younger children remaining at low levels, while trends in the animated group were associated with children learning the interface in a way not associated with age. Findings support that enhanced presentations of scanning can increase the transparency of the scanning interface for some children and suggest that contextual scene displays could benefit from animations and sound for children not using direct selection. © 2018, © 2018 RESNA.",augmentative and alternative communication; computer access; pediatrics; usability,"Animation; Pediatrics; Scanning; Age-related; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Children learning; Computer access; Learning sessions; Living room; usability; Human rehabilitation engineering; age; communication aid; computer; computer interface; female; human; interpersonal communication; male; preschool child; task performance; Age Factors; Child, Preschool; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Computers; Female; Humans; Male; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018842611,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"Macromedia Flash Professional 8, USB Switch Click ",Children,20

Several applications were tested to establish feedback from the users, using the only movement they were capable of: eye movement. Results have shown significant improvement in interaction and communication for both users. Some differences were present, possibly due to the age difference.

Expert user testing is a well recognised tool within user experience and human computer interaction design. Within the domain of assistive technology device design, however, this technique seems to be little used. It is suggested that studying the 'success factors' of expert assistive technology device users may provide a valuable source of data to inform development of assistive technology devices. This paper presents an example of this technique, within the context of a number of studies carried out by the authors, using the example of preliminary data from a study informing the development of an innovative Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device. Main Content. The paper presents a qualitative study whose objective was to influence the design and further development of an innovative voice-input voice-output communication aid (Vivoca) which has previously reached proof-of-concept stage. The Vivoca device is designed for people with dysarthria and this dictates a number of specific constraints and considerations. In order to understand how Vivoca could be designed to be used successfully by people with dysarthria, this study aimed to identify the factors associated with expert users' successful use of current AAC devices. In order to allow comparison, the study included users with some understandable speech and also those with no understandable speech. The study procedure was designed to provide a profile of participants' communication methods and to identify the factors that participants felt made their communication successful. Results. Preliminary results from the study (currently underway) are presented, including a qualitative analysis of interview data, and data profiling participants' communication methods and context. Initial data has highlighted the very specific requirements for a communication aid design for people with some understandable speech. Conclusion. Study of expert users may provide an effective tool to help inform assistive technology device development. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

In fact, as the disease progresses, the patient needs for AT support change and assistive technology devices can soon become of no use to the patient. To assist professionals in the selection of AT devices for Communication, a table that suggests commercially available technologies appropriate to each stage of ALS is presented. This instrument provides a guideline for technology selection, taking into consideration the disease progression. However, it does not substitute a thorough patient assessment, and it does not consider user preferences. The main purpose of developing such a table is to bring into the assistive technology selection process not only the ALS patient present needs but also the envisioned future needs. Prescribing AT with these concerns has the potential to reduce the need to substitute devices as the disease progresses, releasing the patient from the effort to adapt to a different technology and avoiding the usually long time interval before getting a new device, during which the person stays with no useful AT support. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

AAC systems exist to assist people to overcome communication handicaps. Computer-based AAC systems can contain stored communication material for people with impaired communication to retrieve and use during interaction. As the size of the stored information corpus in an AAC system increases, the task of searching and retrieving items from that corpus will become more demanding, which will make it less easy for someone to successfully access and use such material. IV has therefore been investigated here as a way of accessing AAC content. A prototype visualisation interface was developed as a means of retrieving stored biographical text in an AAC context. Trial of this prototype showed that it was possible for people to successfully retrieve the stored information with the IV-based user interface, indicating that an IV-based interface could have potential within AAC. Further work could be pursued to investigate performance with larger corpora and alternative visualisation metaphors; alternative metaphors (using timelines, for example) may be preferred by different people who use AAC. © 2006 IOS Press.

To facilitate the rapid retrieval (and synthesized speech output) of stored content, potential utterances on each conversational topic are organised according to three intersecting perspectives. The perspectives are ""person"" (me, you), ""time"" (past, present, future), and ""issue"" (what, when, where, who, how, why). Although the system has been shown capable of supporting free-flowing conversation with relatively short pauses preceding the user's turns at speech, the perspective organisation is probably less than ideal for some topics. An experiment was conducted to see whether, over a number of conversational topics, storage and retrieval of potential utterances would be faster with the existing, uniform, set of perspectives or with different sets of perspectives tailored to each topic. At the storage stage, the ""uniform"" set of perspectives facilitated more rapid classification of potential utterances than the ""tailore's sets. At the retrieval stage, however, repetition of the classification decisions was more accurate (without being any slower) for the tailored sets of perspectives, suggesting that retrieval of stored utterances during conversation may be faster when the perspective organisation is tailored to topics. © 1996 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",AAC; computer-assisted communication; conversation aid; non-speaking people,adult; article; communication disorder; computer assisted therapy; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; Adult; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Female; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Interpersonal Relations,Short Survey,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052464364,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,TALK ,"Cerebral palsy, MND ",20

A range of layouts are available to these individuals within specialized communication software. However, a paucity of information is available to describe user preferences, user perceptions, as well as the visual-cognitive processing demands of such layouts. Such information is critical to guide clinical decision-making for keyboard selection and to provide patient-centered services. This study: (a) described the preferences and perceptions of two onscreen keyboard layouts (QWERTY and alphabetic) and (b) used eye-tracking analysis to investigate the visual-cognitive processing demands between these onscreen keyboards for individuals with and without BI. Results indicated participants in both groups held a strong preference for QWERTY keyboard interfaces and had extensive prior experience using the QWERTY keyboard layout on mobile devices. Eye-tracking analysis revealed less visual-cognitive processing demands using a QWERTY keyboard layout for both groups but were only statistically significant for those without BI. Results suggest that use of a keyboard layout that aligns with client preferences and prior experiences (i.e., the QWERTY keyboard for these participants) may lead to increased satisfaction with the communication experience and increased communication efficiency. © 2020 RESNA.",augmentative and alternative communication; communication; computer access,Computer keyboards; Decision making; Eye tracking; Human rehabilitation engineering; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Clinical decision making; Cognitive processing; Communication efficiency; Communication software; Eye-tracking analysis; Keyboard interface; On-screen keyboard; User experience,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092455581,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,Tobii X2-60 ,TBI,20

The data consisted of 2 hr and 40 min of video recordings collected in the participants’ classrooms. Three practices were identified (a) the practice of explicit turn allocation organization and the use of display questions, (b) the practice of locally contingent on-screen scaffolding activities, and (c) the practice of dealing with turn competition by classmates. Teacher and assistant practices differed with regard to the student’s access to the vocabulary relevant to answering the teacher’s question.

We have analyzed ECO and carried out a formative evaluation with experts, mainly related to the Manager Communication view. The idea was to assess usability and accessibility concerning AAC tools. This way, we asked evaluators to walkthrough the tool and complete two different questionnaires intended to measure perceived usability and check the most important accessibility requirements. Results were positive and provided evidences of usability and the achievement of accessibility requirements.

The system was tested with four participants with severe cerebral palsy and ranging degrees of linguistic competence and intellectual disabilities. Participants had used pictogram-based AAC at least for the past 30 years each and presented a stable linguistic profile. During tests, which consisted of a total of 40 sessions, participants were able to learn new linguistic skills, such as the use of basic verb tenses, while using the compansion system, which proved a source of motivation. The system can be adapted to the linguistic competence of each person and required no learning curve during tests when none of its special features, like gender, number, verb tense, or sentence type modifiers, were used.

Millions of them are non-verbal, and also experience motor-skill challenges. The limitations on activity and restrictions on participation due to such disabilities often lead to discrimination and social exclusion. A UNICEF study analyzing data from 15 countries found that almost 50% of children with disabilities are out of school, and 85% of them did not receive any formal education. Affording enhanced and accelerated communication for disabled people, who continue to form the world’s largest minority to experience social discrimination, is central to making the world a more inclusive place. Our LIVOX application incorporates artificial intelligence algorithms to reduce the so-called “reciprocity gap” that acts as a communication barrier between disabled people and their interlocutors, thus enabling people with disabilities, especially children, to participate in daily social and educational activities.

To support children who are learning an AAC system, parents must understand how to model communication during naturally occurring activities. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the effects of parent instruction on modeling AAC use in naturally occurring activities. METHODS: An eight-step instruction model was used to teach four parents of children who use AAC to provide partner-augmented input (PAI) using the core vocabularies on their children's speech-generating devices (SGDs) during core family leisure activities. Communication Sampling and Analysis (CSA) was used to compare parent and child language at pretest and post-test. RESULTS: All parents demonstrated the ability to perform all of the components of successful PAI (slow rate, model, respect and reflect, repeat, expand, stop) as determined by review of an observation checklist completed during coaching sessions. Parents significantly increased percentage of utterances modeled on their children's SGDs between pretest and post-test measures. The percentage of unique words modeled (i.e., type-token ratios) by each parent suggests variety in models at post-test. Three of four child participants demonstrated increases in unique words used following parent instruction. CONCLUSIONS: Parent instruction can increase parent modeling and child SGD use. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

Themes explored in this article include the challenge of time, the untimely rate of speech, which can be silencing, planning to talk tomorrow, and finally text time and how this time may lift the burden of time from SGD users. Implications for educators and others who support children and youth who use SGD are brought forward through reflection and discussion of this unique experience of voice and time. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2018.",augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); communication; designs; exceptionalities; language/linguistics; qualitative; research; speech–language pathologists (SLPs); technology,Article; autoregulation; communication disorder; computer model; human; interpersonal communication; language; priority journal; Rett syndrome; speech; speech language pathologist; speech rehabilitation; writing,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045303254,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a ,Children,n/a

The study was conducted through a secondary analysis of a corpus of data collected as part of another study. It documents the production of verbs and the emergence of verb inflections in natural conversations between each of the participants and a member of their educational team over a period of up to 10 months.

The emergence of the inflections -ing, -s, and -ed varied and were distributed selectively with different verb categories and event types. The results are discussed in terms of language development and are considered in terms of the findings from research with children without disabilities, which suggest that action verbs precede state verbs, and inflections are primarily acquired based on their correspondence to the verbal category (action–state).

The scripted calls, asking for directions, were placed to 100 randomly selected businesses. Analysis showed a statistically significant difference in the success rate between the two conditions, with eye gaze access resulting in more successful calls.

The All approach had a unique language model under all locations. One of the location-aware alternatives, the location-specific (Spec) approach, made use of specific language models for pictogram prediction in each location of interest. The other location-aware approach resulted from combining the Spec and the All approaches, and was designated the mixed approach (Mix). In this approach, the language models acquired knowledge from all locations, but a higher relevance was assigned to the vocabulary from the associated location. Results from simulations showed that the Mix and Spec approaches could only outperform the baseline in a statistically significant way if pictogram users reuse more than 50% and 75% of their sentences, respectively. Under low sentence reuse conditions there were no statistically significant differences between the location-aware approaches and the All approach. Under these conditions, the Mix approach performed better than the Spec approach in a statistically significant way. © 2016 RESNA.",adaptive interfaces; communication rate; dynamic screen interfaces; location-awareness; pictogram prediction,"Computational linguistics; Forecasting; Human rehabilitation engineering; User interfaces; Adaptive interface; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communication rate; Location awareness; Mixed approach; Prediction mechanisms; Specific languages; Statistically significant difference; Location; awareness; controlled study; human; human experiment; linguistics; model; prediction; adolescent; adult; communication aid; communication disorder; computer interface; computer simulation; female; image processing; male; procedures; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Disorders; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974727870,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,Pictogram AAC ,Cerebral Palsy,11

Thus diminishing their opportunities to communicate or learn. This population usually needs an alternative input human-computer interface (HCI). The paper presents an alternative multimodal HCI that incorporates a head-mounted interface and superficial electromyography sensors (sEMG). The aim of the study is to assess the usability and the suitability of these two HCI devices. Six non-disabled subjects and ten subjects with DCP participated in the iterative process in which each test follows an improvement of an input. The results indicated that for both systems, the improvements in the usability are remarkable when there were previous training programmes with both interfaces. These tests allowed the identification of the main difficulties associated with disability: poor control of the voluntary muscle contraction, which affects the EMG signal, and abnormal postures, which affect the headmounted interface control. Regarding the EMG signal, the characterisation of the involuntary patterns of muscle contractions may prevent false positives. In the case of the inertial interface, a relative mode control (based on the velocity of the movement instead of posture) may be a solution to increasing the usability and task performance. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Lifelong personal narratives play a key role in developing social identity. Individuals with little or no functional speech due to severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) find it difficult to share personal narrative as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems do not support interactive story telling. As a result, people with congenital SSPI who use AAC may not have learned the linguistic skills involved in sharing narratives. The Chronicles software was developed to support the sharing of personal narrative.

Recent research has demonstrated that perceiving expressive biosignals can facilitate emotional understanding and connection with others, but this work has been largely limited to visual approaches.We propose that hearing these signals will also elicit empathy, and test this hypothesis with sounding heartbeats. In a lab-based within-subjects study, participants (N = 27) completed an emotion recognition task in diferent heartbeat conditions. We found that hearing heartbeats changed participants' emotional perspective and increased their reported ability to feel what the other was feeling. From these results, we argue that auditory heartbeats are well-suited as an empathic intervention, and might be particularly useful for certain groups and use-contexts because of its musical and non-visual nature.

Parents were taught to embed opportunities for their child to communicate with a grid-based AAC application during every-day routines such as play or mealtime. Communication targets included requesting objects using two-step taxonomic navigational responses, and requesting assistance, rejecting items, or making social comments/responses using a two-step message-strip response. During intervention, parents used strategies such as time delay, prompting, reinforcement, and device proximity (faded over time) to encourage target responses. Display formats and intervention targets were selected in consideration of prior dynamic assessment results. Effects of intervention were evaluated using a multiple probe across participants design. For functional navigational AAC item requesting, all three participants showed an immediate increase in responding that maintained at high levels. Functional AAC responding for other communicative purposes also increased, but at a more gradual pace.

Materials and methods: A modified withdrawal (A-B1-A1-B2-A2) single case experimental design with a direct inter-subject replication across three participants was applied. Three women with Rett syndrome participated. The study took place over a six-week period and comprised 32 sessions with each participant. All sessions were video recorded. During the intervention the communication partner used aided language modelling on a gaze-controlled device in combination with using responsive partner strategies. Expressive communication was assessed as synthesised words per minute and unique synthesised words per minute. Visual attention was assessed as rate of focused gazes (1 s or longer) in interaction. Results: An intervention effect was found on the rate of unique words for all participants. The rate of words increased for two participants when the intervention was introduced but no withdrawal effect could be seen. An intervention effect on visual attention could be seen for one participant. The intervention appeared to have social validity as reported by caregivers. Conclusion: Aided language modelling (ALM), while using responsive partner strategies and a gaze-controlled device may be used with adult individuals with Rett syndrome to increase their rate of expressive communication. Detailed observational measures revealed individual learning patterns, which may provide clinically valuable insights.Implications for Rehabilitation Adults with Rett syndrome may benefit from access to gaze-controlled devices in combination with responsive partner strategies. Responsive partner communication may be effective for some individuals with Rett syndrome to increase their rate of synthesised utterances. Rate of focused gazes may be considered as an outcome measure for individuals with oculomotor difficulties when introducing aided language modelling. © 2021 The Author(s).

Brain–computer interface (BCI) access techniques may serve alongside existing AAC access methods to provide communication device control. However, there is limited information available about how individual perspectives change with motor-based BCI-AAC learning. Four individuals with ALS completed 12 BCI-AAC training sessions in which they made letter selections during an automatic row-column scanning pattern via a motor-based BCI-AAC. Recurring measures were taken before and after each BCI-AAC training session to evaluate changes associated with BCI-AAC performance, and included measures of fatigue, frustration, mental effort, physical effort, device satisfaction, and overall ease of device control. Levels of pre- to post-fatigue were low for use of the BCI-AAC system. However, participants indicated different perceptions of the term fatigue, with three participants discussing fatigue to be generally synonymous with physical effort, and one mental effort. Satisfaction with the BCI-AAC system was related to BCI-AAC performance for two participants, and levels of frustration for two participants. Considering a range of person-centered measures in future clinical BCI-AAC applications is important for optimizing and standardizing BCI-AAC assessment procedures. © 2021 RESNA.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; augmentative and alternative communication; brain–computer interface; fatigue; perspectives; satisfaction,Human rehabilitation engineering; Access techniques; Assessment procedure; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Communication device; Device control; Limited information; Physical impairments; Training sessions; Brain computer interface,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110885162,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,BCI-AAC ,ALS,4

A questionnaire consisting of a series of rating and open-ended questions was used to gather perspectives and insights related to a hypothetical SLR device. The survey was distributed to members of the Deaf community, family and friends of Deaf individuals, and service providers, all of whom had some proficiency in American Sign Language (ASL). The average ratings provided by Deaf participants were distributed normally with a right-modal skew in the direction of the positive ratings. Six fundamental concerns about SLR technologies were identified from participants’ responses, with the most frequently cited pertaining to the technology’s feasibility. In descending order, participants ranked translation accuracy, speed, and comfort as the three most important design characteristics for potential SLR devices. Respondents identified many potential situations in which SLR devices could be used. For a SLR device to be user-centric and culturally appropriate, it is essential that future work in the field integrates perspectives from members of the Deaf community. © 2021 RESNA.",auditory impairment; augmentative and alternative communication; communication; electronic aids to daily living; sign language recognition; survey research; wearable sensors,Wearable technology; American sign language; Design characteristics; Open-ended questions; Service provider; Sign language; Sign Language recognition; User-centric; Surveys,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106474350,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,Wearable sign language recognition device ,DHH,102

An analysis of conversation turns considers how conversation participants co-construct conversation processes, whereas an analysis of speaking roles considers how conversation participants co-construct conversation contents. The purpose of the current study was to explore the quantitative contributions of conversation turns and speaking roles in familiar Mandarin Chinese conversation dyads between adults who use SGDs and adults who use natural speech. Five dyads were recruited, and each dyad contained two participants; an adult using an SGD and an adult using natural speech. Each dyadic conversation was individually video-recorded for about 20 minutes, six times. A total of 30 dyadic conversations were analyzed. The means and percentages of the coded conversation turns and speaking roles were computed. Quantitatively asymmetrical contributions of conversation turns and speaking roles occurred in the Mandarin Chinese conversation dyads between the adults who use SGDs and the adults who use natural speech. The adults who use natural speech contributed significantly more conversation turns and speaking roles than did the adults who use SGDs.

The aims were to investigate the learning patterns of two adults with severe cerebral palsy when first introduced to the multimodal access technique and then to compare the accuracy and efficiency of multimodal to single-modality access when selecting targets on an AAC visual scene display. The participants learned to use the multimodal access technique; they demonstrated improvements in their accuracy of selection across sessions and attained at least 80% accuracy within 3-15 training sessions. Both participants achieved similar accuracy with multimodal access compared to single-modality, but took longer to select targets with multimodal access compared to single-modality.

In addition to academic and behavioral interventions, paraeducators also need to be prepared to support students with complex communication needs. This study was designed to investigate the effects of a paraeducator-implemented communication intervention in a public school. A multiple probe design across participants was used to evaluate a communication intervention that included providing opportunities to initiate with least-to-most prompting for a 10-year-old student with autism who used an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device. Prior to the intervention, the student was rarely observed initiating interactions with her AAC device, and paraeducators were rarely observed offering opportunities to initiate or providing supports to help the student initiate. Following training, data from each paraeducator indicated an increased rate when providing the communication intervention and as a result, the student displayed an increase in the targeted intervention, initiation. Findings from the intervention highlight the need for explicit teaching when promoting initiation among students with autism who use AAC. © 2021 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Augmentative and alternative communication; autism; behavioral skills training; classroom-based; naturalistic intervention; paraeducator,Diseases; Human rehabilitation engineering; Personnel training; Augmentative and alternative communication devices; Behavioral interventions; Children with autisms; Complex communication needs; Probe design; Public schools; Skills training; Special education; Students,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104289840,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,"TouchChat, iPad mini",Autism,4

Although augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) can be of benefit, the AAC intervention must support beginning communicators in the early social interactions that provide the foundation for more sophisticated communication skills. An AAC video visual scene display approach uses an AAC app (provided on a tablet computer), including videos based on the interests of the child and infused with AAC supports, to provide opportunities for social interaction and communication between the child and the communication partner. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of video visual scene display technology on the communicative turns taken by three preschoolers with ASD and complex communication needs during a high-interest, shared activity (i.e., watching videos). All three participants demonstrated a large increase in the number of communicative turns taken with their partner (Tau-U of 1.00) following the introduction of the video VSD app. The results provide evidence that a video VSD approach may be a promising intervention to increase participation in communication opportunities for young children with ASD. © 2021 RESNA.",augmentative and alternative communication; autism spectrum disorder; preschoolers; social interaction,Diseases; Display devices; Human rehabilitation engineering; User experience; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Communication partners; Communication skills; Complex communication needs; Display technologies; Social interactions; Speech communication,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103879578,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"EasyVSD, Tablet",Autism ,3

Methods: Nine individuals with aphasia and no previous experience with AAC searched for five symbols on two grid display apps with differing representation systems and vocabulary (Proloquo2Go and Speak for Yourself) following a brief demonstration. Participants were allowed two minutes to locate each symbol on each app (Trial 1), following which the process was repeated with the same symbols (Trial 2) for both apps. Measured variables included total number of symbols found as well as average efficiency score, search time per symbol, and number of cell selections per second for successful trials. Participants were interviewed about their stated app preferences. Results: In the absence of training, participants performed significantly better using Proloquo2Go for average search time (p <.001), and rate of cell selection (p <.001). No significant differences were found across trials. Seven of the nine participants expressed a preference for Proloquo2Go. Conclusions: Participant performance and stated preferences appeared to favour the layout found in Proloquo2Go, possibly suggestive of greater intuitiveness in the absence of training. However, significant learning was not observed across two trials, suggesting the importance of training and increased exposure.Implications for Rehabilitation Individuals who are diagnosed with aphasia may have long-term communication difficulties that require alternative means of communication. There are numerous commercially available augmentative and alternative communication applications (AAC apps) which may be beneficial for this population. However, there is limited research examining their usefulness.

Jellow app is a mobile app designed for compensating for impaired language skills and may be used in the intervention of persons with aphasia. The study aimed to determine the benefits of using the Jellow app as a facilitator of stimulus therapy to improve language and psychosocial domains in chronic Broca's Aphasia. Methods: Ten right-handed male adults with Broca's Aphasia were assessed on WAB and SIQOL39g tests. The control group (n = 5) was enrolled only for stimulation therapy. Pictures of objects were used for therapy with the help of auditory or auditory and visual cues. In the study group (n = 5), along with stimulus therapy, subjects were also trained on the use of icons in the Jellow app to facilitate functional communication needs. After six-months tests were readministered. Results: Post-therapy, on WAB, the improvement in spontaneous speech, repetition, and naming were found to be significantly more in the study group (4.6 ± 0.55, 4.89 ± 0.56, 5.74 ± 0.24 respectively) than the control group (2.6 ± 0.89, 3.22 ± 0.49, 3.97 ± 0.3 respectively) on 2-sample t-test. Similarly, significantly more improvement was seen in the communication domain of SAQOL39g in the study group (2.03 ± 0.17) compared to the control group (1.14 ± 0.45). Conclusion: Use of the Jellow app may be a beneficial adjunct to stimulation therapy for improving linguistic abilities and quality of life in persons with chronic Broca's aphasia.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Following are the implications of this study in the rehabilitation of persons with chronic Broca's Aphasia: • Multimodality in therapy approach in traditional stimulation therapy is beneficial. • AAC Apps like the Jellow app can be used as an adjunct to the traditional stimulation approach of language intervention which facilitates the language abilities like spontaneous speech, repetition, and naming. • Language improvement due to rehabilitation is beneficial in improving the quality of life in this population. • The caregivers must be involved in the therapy program as they act as communication partners and can repeat the therapy tasks at home. • Similar type of study is warranted in a larger population so that people with chronic Broca's aphasia may get the benefit of the latest technology which may be cheaper and easier to use. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",AAC; Functional communication; nonfluent Aphasia; quality of life,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102509005,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Jellow App,Aphasia,10

Most plwMND eventually use an augmentative and alternative communication device (AAC) to communicate. Some AAC devices provide a synthesized voice for speech, however these voices are often viewed as impersonal and a factor in AAC acceptance. Voice banking creates an approximation of the person's own voice that can be used in AAC and is argued to go some way to preserve a person's identity when natural voice is lost, but there has been little supporting research. Aims: To understand what plwMND consider when deciding whether or not to bank their voice, what their expectations are, and the expectations of significant communication partners. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with plwMND who had either decided to bank their voice or had decided not to. Thematic analysis was used to provide a qualitative analysis of the data. Procedures: Participants were an opportunistic sample of plwMND within England recruited via an open advert distributed by the MND Association (MNDA). Outcomes and Results: Twelve plwMND were interviewed with nine significant others. Nine participants had decided to bank their voice and three decided not to. The data suggest ‘preserving identity’ is the overarching motivation in decision making for voice banking. Participants who decided to voice bank considered it would help to maintain their identity and preserve their social and work networks. Participants deciding not to bank their voice highlighted it could not replace their natural voice or preserve their identity. However, few in either group showed an awareness of how a voice bank is used in AAC, and how communication using AAC is significantly different to natural speech. Conclusions and Implications: This research is the first study of its kind to examine the considerations for decision making around voice banking for plwMND. Preserving identity is central to decision making when considering whether or not to voice bank. However, the reality of using AAC and voice banking for communication is poorly understood. Professionals have a role to provide plwMND with more information about voice banking in the wider context of using AAC for communication. It may be that the process of voice banking itself is seen as a positive act for plwMND, independent of how it is used later. Further research with associated professionals and stakeholders is indicated. What this paper adds What is already known on this subject Voice banking creates an approximation of the person.s own voice that can be used in AAC, and is argued to go some way to preserve a person's identity when natural voice is lost. There is significant and growing interest in voice banking from the MND community, but there has been little supporting research. What this study adds This research is the first study of its kind to examine decision making surrounding voice banking. It shows how preserving identity is critically important in how people deal with a diagnosis of MND. For those choosing to voice bank, it is seen as an effective way of preserving their identity, a way of ‘fighting back’ and giving a positive psychological benefit. Those deciding against voice banking do not believe it could maintain their identity and cannot bring back the natural voice they once had. Clinical implications of this study The reality of using AAC and voice banking for communication may be poorly understood. It would be helpful for professionals to provide information about voice banking as part of a wider discussion about the range of options for communication as the condition progresses. It is important that this includes the opportunity to listen to a voice bank to support understanding of how it is used in a communication device, and how different it sounds to natural speech. © 2020 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists",ALS; augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); Motor Neurone Disease; progressive neurological disorders; Voice and Iden,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097862070,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,Voice banking ,MND ,21

Specifically, a mentor can transmit just-in-time (JIT) visual supports (e.g., video clips, photographs, text) that depict an upcoming directive to a learner’s smart watch to prompt the learner as needed from a distance. Using a single-case multiple probe design across settings, this investigation evaluated the effectiveness of providing text-based prompts on an Apple Watch 1 to a child with ASD within a school setting. A mentor transmitted 2-step written directives via text message to the participant’s Apple Watch. The participant was instructed to attend to, read, and follow directives received on the watch. Results demonstrated that the intervention improved directive-following as well as increased the instructor’s distance from the learner. It is proposed that JIT supports sent to a learner’s smart watch may reduce the obtrusiveness of traditional prompting while also maintaining the naturalness of ongoing social or academic interactions.

These verbally challenged children require the support of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) for intercommunication. Therefore, during COVID-19, assistance must be provided remotely to these users by a AAC team involving caregivers, teachers, Speech Language Therapist (SLT) to ensure collaborative learning and development of non-verbal child communication skills. However, most of the advanced AAC, such as Speech Generating Devices (SGD), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) based mobile applications (Android & iOS) are designed considering the scenario of developed countries and less accessible in developing countries. Therefore, in this study, we are focusing on representing feasible short term strategies, prospective challenges and as long term strategy, a cloud based framework entitled as “Bolte Chai+”, which is an intelligent integrated collaborative learning platform for non-verbal children, parents, caregivers, teachers and SLT. The intelligent analytics within the platform monitors child overall progress by tracking child activity in mobile application and conversely support parents and AAC team to concentrate on individual child ubiquitous abilities.

Unfortunately, most of the existing systems offering electronic CBs require the purchase of high-cost eye tracking hardware and software components and do not support Arabic language. We have, therefore, developed a low-cost gaze interaction-based Arabic language application to assist pre-literate and early literate individuals with SSMI whose primary language is Arabic to communicate with people in their vicinity. The system utilizes a webcam and open source software for eye tracking, thus, avoiding the need for expensive proprietary eye tracking components. It offers several CBs from which the user can select items to form sentences that are output as speech. The CBs have been carefully designed taking the users’ cognitive and motor capabilities into consideration and several features to facilitate and expedite the communication process have been included. An interface has also been provided for caregivers to customize the application according to the users’ unique needs by adding and editing items, and setting the user’s profile, the background color and the gender for the speech output.

However, available Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) tools such as gaze-controlled keyboards have limited abilities. In particular, they do not allow for expression of emotions in addition to words. In this paper we propose a novel gaze-based speaking tool that enable locked-in syndrome patients to express emotions as well as sentences. It also features patient-controlled emotionally modulated speech synthesis. Additionally, an emotional 3D avatar can be controlled by the patient to represent emotional facial-expressions. The systems were tested with 36 people without disabilities separated into an affective group - full control of emotional voice, avatar facial expressions and laugh - and a control group - no emotional tools. The study proved the system’s capacity to enhance communication for both the patient and the interlocutor. The emotions embedded in the synthesized voices were found recognizable at 80% on the first trial and 90% on the second trial. The conversation was perceived as more natural when using the affective tool. The subjects felt it was easier to express and identify emotions using this system. The emotional voice and the emotional avatar were found to help the conversation. This highlights the needs for more affective-driven communicative solutions for locked-in patients. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Communication; Emotions; Eye-tracking; Gaze,Human rehabilitation engineering; Speech synthesis; Three dimensional computer graphics; Affective communication; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Control groups; Emotional voices; Express emotions; Facial Expressions; Locked-in syndrome; Human computer interaction,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088751237,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,Emotional Avatar,Locked in syndrome,36

VOCA device plays back words or sentences recorded in human voice by pressing SWs. It may also read words or sentences in synthetic voices. It is effective for students with disabilities in language communication. Current mainstream VOCA devices are rich in functions, and some devices can customize functions according to user's needs. In special support education, such VOCA devices are very convenient. However, in some cases, it may be unnecessary for the VOCA which provide multiple functions and customization at a school for special support education, because teachers must perform various tasks every day. Such schools, simplified VOCA that can only record and play back by SW operation would be useful. And it is desirable ideally be able to be purchased at a low cost. The purpose of this study is to develop a low cost simplified VOCA prototype device which can be used by simple operation at schools for special support education.

The design is the first of its kind and there has not been any similar research linked to testing the design in the Czech Republic. OBJECTIVE: Our original intention was to develop a device that could give a voice to people with severe health problems and enable them to verbalise their thoughts after medical treatment in hospital. METHODS: Participatory design was used throughout the development and we employed participatory observation, informal interviews and simple questionnaire for the research of the possibilities of the design implementation in a hospital environment. RESULTS: Target group accepted the design we developed without any major problems and, at the same time, the design, and its possibilities of implementation and usage, was improved by participation of people who will be potentially using it. Given that our target group consists mainly of older adults with some kind of complex communication need, possibly acquired disability, we had to consider these aspects during development, as there is, for example, a problem in that older adults can have difficulty using technologies. CONCLUSION: Our design is usable in a hospital environment without any major problems. Participatory design is a very effective approach for making any design better and more usable by a target group, and for minimising bias, stigmatization and exclusion. © 2019-IOS Press and the authors.

In addition, many gaze models and communication systems with the line-of-sight using avatars have been proposed and developed. However, the gaze behaviors by generating the above-mentioned models are not considered to enhance the embodied interaction such as activated communication, because the models stochastically generate the eyeball movements based on the human gaze behavior. Therefore, we analyzed the interaction between the human gaze behavior and the activated communication by using line-of-sight measurement devices. Then, we proposed an eye gaze model based on the above-mentioned analysis. In this study, we develop an advanced avatar-mediated communication system in which the proposed eye gaze model is applied to speech-driven embodied entrainment characters called “InterActor.” This system generates the avatar’s eyeball movements such as gaze and looking away based on the activated communication, and provides a communication environment wherein the embodied interaction is promoted. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated by means of sensory evaluations of 24 pairs of subjects involved in avatar-mediated communication. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Activated communication; Eye gaze model; Human interaction; Nonverbal communication,Behavioral research; Human computer interaction; Communication environments; Embodied communication; Embodied interaction; Eye-gaze; Human interactions; Line-of-sight measurements; Mediated Communication; Non-verbal communications; Speech communication,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025172011,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,InterActors ,n/a,24

One type of aided display is called a Visual Scene Display (VSD). VSDs consist of integrated scenes (such as photographs) in which language concepts are embedded. Often, the representations of concepts on VSDs are perceptually similar to their referents. Given this physical resemblance, one may ask how well VSDs support development of symbolic functioning. We used brain imaging techniques to examine whether matches and mismatches between the content of spoken messages and photographic images of scenes evoke neural activity similar to activity that occurs to spoken or written words. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 15 college students who were shown photographs paired with spoken phrases that were either matched or mismatched to the concepts embedded within each photograph. Of interest was the N400 component, a negative deflecting wave 400 ms post-stimulus that is considered to be an index of semantic functioning. An N400 response in the mismatched condition (but not the matched) would replicate brain responses to traditional linguistic symbols. An N400 was found, exclusively in the mismatched condition, suggesting that mismatches between spoken messages and VSD-type representations set the stage for the N400 in ways similar to traditional linguistic symbols. © 2014 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",Augmentative and alternative communication; Electrophysiology; N400; Symbols,Brain mapping; Codes (symbols); Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Human rehabilitation engineering; Neurons; Photography; Semantics; Speech communication; Students; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Brain imaging techniques; College students; Linguistic symbols; Mismatched conditions; N400; Neural activity; Photographic image; Brain; adolescent; adult; brain; communication aid; electroencephalography; evoked response; female; human; interpersonal communication; male; normal human; physiology; semantics; speech perception; vision; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Semantics; Speech Perception; Visual Perception; Young Adult,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923105805,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,N400 VSD,n/a ,15

In this way the varying needs among several smaller groups of users of AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) may be met as part of a more inclusively designed [1] mainstream environment of much broader interest. With support from the EU via the AEGIS project, a ""CCF-SymbolServer"" has been developed. It can be installed locally on any of the major desktop platforms (GNU/Linux, MacOS X and Windows), or online, to support many kinds of local or web based services and networked mobile systems. In any of these environments the CCF-SymbolServer can provide its multilingual and multi-modal representation services to other applications. Three such applications, developed and tested with users within AEGIS, are presented: 1) CCF-SymbolWriter, an extension for symbol support in LibreOffice/OpenOffice Writer; 2) CCF-SymbolDroid, an AAC app for Android mobile devices; 3) the new CCF supported version of Special Access to Windows (SAW6).

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to all communication forms that can complement or replace speech. The practice of AAC mediated by computational applications represents a very attractive alternative. For people with motor and speech difficulties, gestural interaction can be a way to make interaction with AAC systems feasible. In this thesis, a methodology called MyPGI (Methodology to yield Personalized Gestural Interaction) was developed and validated to guide the design of AAC systems for people with motor and speech difficulties in order to promote greater autonomy for them in handling computer systems and for monitoring by their caregivers. The methodology uses Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques to enable non-invasive and personalized gestural interaction using low-cost devices. MyPGI was applied and evaluated in real case studies with people with disabilities, informing the design of an interactive system named PGCA (Personal Gesture Communication Assistant) to allow the creation and use of personalized gestural languages for people with severe motor and speech difficulties.

Our system concept represents one approach to realizing these goals, however, we contribute the goals and the system as a starting point for future innovations in personalized video-based AAC.","aac, complex communication needs, video",,Conference Paper,ACM,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Vid2Speech,AAC users ,n/a

Thus, AAC interventions are not widely used in inclusive school settings. Students with disabilities often experience problems in an inclusive school setting. Specifically, students who have difficulty with verbal communication may get into trouble more often than typically developing students. They usually have the behavioral problem due to their limited communication, and it makes them isolated in the class. Using AAC interventions in inclusive school settings may alleviate these difficulties. In Korea, only two studies have examined the use of AAC interventions in an inclusive setting (Lee & Park, 2007; Lim & Park, 2011).In this study, we used a pre-post single case design to examine the effects of an AAC intervention on class participation, peer interaction, and literacy skills for a student with severe disability in an inclusive elementary school setting..

Through this SMAD, a user with motor disabilities is able to control home devices from a wheelchair by means of biological signals captured on muscles (sEMG) and eyes (EOG/VOG). Our SMAD focuses on the following end-user features: ease of setup and use, low cost and customizability. The functional design of the interface has been driven by a user-centered performance analysis. Moreover, the system has been conceived to be adaptable to the user's degree of disability. The physical communication between wheelchair and devices on the environment employs radio-frequency (RF), infrared (IR) and Bluetooth (BT). Two scenarios are presented, using respectively facial gestures and eyes movements through Emotiv EPOC and Eye Tribe Tracker. Experimental results show fulfilling performance for the first scenario. The second scenario is an evolution of the first one, in which preliminary results indicate greater usability of the control interface; however the system must undergo testing by a larger number of people for better accuracy performance. During offline and online sessions, users succeeded in employing our SMAD to operate home devices, simulating common needs of people with disabilities, with accuracy above 90% and information transmission rate of up to 53 bits/min.

For the people who use these systems, it is important that the message construction task be fast and physically comfortable; unfortunately, current systems are often slow and require repetitive physical movements that are fatiguing. The current work aims to examine three main assumptions that are commonly made during the design of icon-based AAC systems. These assumptions may contribute to design decisions that place the major burden of work on the user rather than the system. This work aims to remove these assumptions from the design process and address the resulting problems with a systematic set of algorithms and design approaches. By mitigating the need for these fundamental design assumptions, it may be possible to shift work from the user to the system and allow for faster, less fatiguing communication.

In this work, we explore how socially assistive robots, framed as ''sidekicks,'' might provide augmented communicators (ACs) with a nonverbal channel of communication to support their conversational goals. We developed and conducted an accessible co-design workshop that involved two ACs, their caregivers, and three motion experts. We identified goals for conversational support, co-designed prototypes depicting possible sidekick forms, and enacted different sidekick motions and behaviors to achieve speakers' goals. We contribute guidelines for designing sidekicks that support ACs according to three key parameters: attention, precision, and timing.

The first experiment compares (quantitatively and qualitatively) each technology in the context of text generation. The second experiment looks at typical pointing tasks (e.g., dragging) for each technology. The third experiment will look at the technologies in an integrated context.

Because many individuals with severe speech impairments have concomitant limb impairments, repetitive and precise movements can be slow and effortful. The current work aims to enhance message formulation ease and speed by using continuous motion icon selection rather than discrete input. SymbolPath is an overlay module that can be integrated with existing icon-based AAC systems to enable continuous motion icon selection. Message formulation using SymbolPath consists of drawing a continuous path through a set of desired icons. The system then determines the most likely subset of desired icons on that path and rearranges them to form a meaningful and grammatical sentence.

The communicators we present are based on a component-based framework called ULYSSES that aims to simplify the integration of multi-vendor components into low cost products and maximizes modularity and reusability. Following the ULYSSES approach, one can build up powerful and reliable applications, adaptable to various user needs and requirements. For developers of AAC components, ULYSSES provides an engineering-for-reuse environment with guidelines and tools to build software modules, which can operate effectively and interact with each other transparently, without even being aware of each other's existence. Furthermore, ULYSSES grants a process of engineering-with-reuse for AAC system integrators for the selection and assembly of components on demand to build user-specific robust communicators out of pre-fabricated software parts. Thus, adding or removing characteristics and features as needed, is becoming an easy task for system AAC systems integrators. Three complete Interpersonal Communication Aids are presented as cases of ULYSSES application in this specific domain.","communication aids, Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), component based development, communicators, framework architecture",,Conference Paper,ACM,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Natural Language Communicator, BLISS Communicator, MAKATON Communicator","Cognitive, Motor, Learning disabilities ",n/a

This system uses a machine learning model---specifically dynamic time warping---to match the user's input to their unique dictionary to help them be understood by their communication partner. TranslatAble is highly flexible and person-centered, which allows it to adapt to fit the unique needs of each user's unique communication needs. We expect this novel device to enable individuals with complex communication needs to interact with a larger social circle.

This disorder can impair the expression and understanding of language as well as reading and writing. Many people with CI try to use Augmented and Alternative Communication (AAC) to help them recognize and produce spoken phrases. AAC often uses pictures to serve as memory cues for forgotten words or in enabling them to express needs and share experiences. However, AAC typically uses standard clip-art that does not always convey meaningful information to their users or pre-set conversation scenarios. As a result, people with CI eventually abandon their AAC, which leads to facing difficulties in daily life activities. Our objective in this research is to understand how to support AAC users with a rich contextual information communication aid that can empower people with CI in any conversational setting especially (unplanned/unfamiliar) and not limit them with a list of vocabularies or photos.

The system consists of a virtual keyboard comprising a set of keypads which allow entering characters or full words by a single-switch selection process. It also comprises a sophisticated word prediction component which dynamically calculates the most appropriate words for a given context. This component is auto-adaptive, i.e. it learns on every text the user has entered. It thus adapts its predictions to the user's language and the current topic of communication as well. So far the system works for French, German and English. Earlier versions of SIBYLLE have been used since 2001 in the Kerpape rehabilitation center (Brittany, France).","user adaptation, word prediction latent semantic analysis, keystroke saving rate, virtual keyboard, augmentative and alternative communication",,Conference Paper,ACM,,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Sibylle ,"Motor impairments, LIS, Locked in syndrome ",20

Optimization is based on phoneme transition likelihoods (i.e., the probability of transitioning from one phoneme to another in a particular communication corpus), similar to letter-to-letter transition likelihoods used to optimize orthographic interfaces. However, it is unknown to what extent phoneme transition likelihoods vary by corpus, nor how optimizing based on different corpora affects the final interface efficiency. Here we used computational evaluations to compare phoneme transition likelihoods between various phonemic corpora and optimize phonemic interfaces with each corpus. Each interface's efficiency was evaluated against all the corpora. Phoneme-to-phoneme transitions were highly correlated across corpora (r = 0.7-0.86). Optimization based on phoneme-to-phoneme transition likelihoods improved efficiency by around 20-30% compared to random phonemic layouts, regardless of the corpus used to optimize the interface. Optimizations using different corpora were similar, varying only by 3-5%. We conclude that, if possible, future phonemic interfaces should be optimized via a corpus from the intended user's communication. If this is not possible, however, optimization still improved efficiency using all testing corpora, suggesting that optimizing via any relevant corpus is indicated over other layouts.","augmentative and alternative communication (aac), minimal movement capabilities, corpus-based optimizations, phonemic interface, fitts' law",,Conference Paper,ACM,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Phonemic Interfaces ,AAC users ,n/a

A pilot study with 16 able-bodied participants showed that our predictive methods led to a 108.4% increase in phoneme entry speed and a 79.0% reduction in phoneme error rate. The benefits of the predictive methods were also demonstrated in a case study with a cerebral palsied participant. Moreover, results of a comparative evaluation conducted with the same participant after 16 sessions using iSCAN indicated that our system outperformed an orthographic-based predictive communication device that the participant has used for over 4 years.","augmentative and alternative communication, phoneme-based communication, phoneme prediction, word prediction",,Conference Paper,ACM,,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"iSCAN, Say-It!

Dwell-free eye-typing is in principle possible because we can exploit the high redundancy of natural languages to allow users to simply look at or near their desired letters without stopping to dwell on each letter. As a first step we created a system that simulated a perfect recognizer for dwell-free eye-typing. We used this system to investigate how fast users can potentially write using a dwell-free eye-typing interface. We found that after 40 minutes of practice, users reached a mean entry rate of 46 wpm. This indicates that dwell-free eye-typing may be more than twice as fast as the current state-of-the-art methods for writing by gaze.

Deploying sensors inside a patient's mouth can be uncomfortable for long-term use and contact-based sensors like EMG electrodes can cause skin abrasion. To address this problem, we present a novel contact-less sensor, called Tongue-n-Cheek, that captures tongue gestures using an array of micro-radars. The array of micro-radars act as proximity sensors and capture muscle movements when the patient performs the tongue gesture.

Our motivation is to help people who can no longer speak following laryngectomy, a procedure that is carried out tens of thousands of times per year in the Western world. Our method for sensing articulator movement, permanent magnetic articulography, relies on small, unobtrusive magnets attached to the lips and tongue. Changes in magnetic field caused by magnet movements are sensed and form the input to a process that is trained to estimate speech acoustics. In the experiments reported here this â€œDirect Synthesisâ€ technique is developed for normal speakers, with glued-on magnets, allowing us to train with parallel sensor and acoustic data. We describe three machine learning techniques for this task, based on Gaussian mixture models, deep neural networks, and recurrent neural networks RNNs. We evaluate our techniques with objective acoustic distortion measures and subjective listening tests over spoken sentences read from novels the CMU Arctic corpus. Our results show that the best performing technique is a bidirectional RNN BiRNN, which employs both past and future contexts to predict the acoustics from the sensor data. BiRNNs are not suitable for synthesis in real time but fixed-lag RNNs give similar results and, because they only look a little way into the future, overcome this problem. Listening tests show that the speech produced by this method has a natural quality that preserves the identity of the speaker. Furthermore, we obtain up to 92% intelligibility on the challenging CMU Arctic material. To our knowledge, these are the best results obtained for a silent-speech system without a restricted vocabulary and with an unobtrusive device that delivers audio in close to real time.

With only limited exposure to the T2L feature, the five participants all demonstrated increased accuracy in identification of 10 target words. Four of the five participants generalized learning to use a text-only display for the 10 target words. This study provides preliminary evidence that redesigning AAC apps to include the provision of dynamic text combined with speech output can positively impact the single-word reading of participants. This adaptation in AAC system design could be used to support improved outcomes in both language and literacy. © The Author(s) 2020.",apps; augmentative and alternative communication; literacy; severe disability,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084480032,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"T2L app, NOVA Chat 12, Tablet ","IDD, Children ",5

This study involved 20 dyads: 10 in which one individual had ALS and primarily used an SGD for communication while the other participant primarily used speech (AS group); and 10 in a control group comprised of individuals who used speech as a primary means of communication (OS group). Interactions between participants in the AS group were compared across four tasks (i.e., map, retell, sequencing, and personal narrative). These results were also compared to performances of participants in the OS group performing the same tasks. Task completion times, talk times, contribution types (i.e., main/repair), and contribution functions (i.e., presentation/acceptance) were used to index symmetry performance patterns across tasks for the 20 dyads. Within- and between-group comparisons were significant in differentiating the two groups in terms of the ways in which they were able to adapt to different interaction task dynamics. Findings suggest symmetry is a useful metric for identifying the constraining influence of carrying out in-person interactions with an SGD. © 2020 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Augmentative and alternative communication; interaction media; social interaction; symmetry,Communication; Speech; Completion time; Contribution function; Control groups; Interaction dynamics; Performance patterns; Personal narratives; Speech generating devices; Speech communication; adult; aged; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; communication aid; communication disorder; female; human; human relation; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; speech; Adult; Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Communication; Communication Aids for Disabled; Communication Disorders; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Speech,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088507704,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,"Mercury II, Dynavox, Dynawrite, Eirca, Freedom Lite, Cyrano ",ALS,30

They often rely on alternate methods to supplement or replace verbal communication. There is a rapidly growing number of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) mobile applications available over recent years. However, the operation of these applications remains a challenge for users with ID since they may not have the sufficient cognitive proficiency to cope with the application interface. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based context-aware AAC system. Our system facilitates daily communication for nonverbal school children with moderate ID in order to address their learning and communication needs. We have piloted and evaluated our system at a special education school in Hong Kong. Our technical contribution is twofold. First, we introduce BLE technology to the AAC field and show its effectiveness on users with ID. Second, by converting conventionally standalone AAC software into a service system and empowering it with Internet of Things functionality, we open up many new opportunities brought by the system-of-systems (SoS) paradigm for the intellectually disabled population. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC); Bluetooth low energy (BLE); context awareness; intellectual disabilities (ID); Internet of Things (IoT),Bluetooth; Internet of things; Systems engineering; Augmentative-and-alternative communication; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Context- awareness; Intellectual disability; Internet of Things (IOT); Human rehabilitation engineering,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081628793,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"BLE AAC app, Tablet","IDD, Children ",6

For those who are non-verbal or have complex speech and language difficulties, AI has the potential to offer enhanced access to the wider world of communication that can be personalized to suit user needs. Examples include pictographic symbols to augment or provide an alternative to spoken language. However, when using AI models, data related to the use of freely available symbol sets is scarce. Moreover, the manipulation of the data available is difficult with limited annotation, making semantic and syntactic predictions and classification a challenge in multilingual situations. Harmonization between symbol sets has been hard to achieve; this paper aims to illustrate how AI can be used to improve the situation. The goal is to provide an improved automated mapping system between various symbol sets, with the potential to enhance access to more culturally sensitive multilingual symbols. Ultimately, it is hoped that the results can be used for better context sensitive symbol to text or text to symbol translations for speech generating devices and web content. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",AI and inclusion; Alternative and augmentative communication; Complex communication needs; Web accessibility,Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Semantics; Speech communication; Automated mapping; Context sensitive; Label images; Natural languages; Pictographic symbols; Speech generating devices; Speech output; Spoken languages; Translation (languages),Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091529144,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a,AAC users,n/a

Traditionally, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) methods (e.g., gestures and communication boards) have been utilized for communication. Traditional systems, however, are inconvenient for impaired users, because it is difficult to find specific items from a huge symbol dictionary. Thus, most systems only allow users to produce a few words or phrases. Users cannot express a large variety of statements to achieve a desired goal. However, with these systems, vocabularies can conveniently be seeded from large database by context-aware mechanisms. Additionally, most context-aware AAC systems use location as a context. In this paper, we present a context-aware AAC system that uses not only location context, but also context history, with a dynamic user interface. We include vocabulary as a factor of the context history by leveraging time, week, and frequency to prioritize AAC categories and items. Moreover, we attach a variety of complete sentences to each AAC item to assist impaired users during their daily interactions. © 2018 Newswood Limited.

We developed software-based techniques and evaluated the system using established methods from the field of Special Education. We present the results of a deployment in a special education school that demonstrates that an assistive tablet game is a feasible means of addressing overselectivity, and we present generalizable technological features drawn from evidenced-based therapies to consider in future assistive technologies.

Observations of group therapy sessions featuring high-tech AAC use and focus groups with the clinicians from those sessions provided further nuance and insight into usage and adoption. It was shown that “smart” mobile devices are garnering acceptance as a promising platform for high-tech AAC; however, contrary to the authors’ expectations, these devices are not being paired with mobile versions of traditional picture dictionaries.

Methods: The client was repeatedly presented with visual and audiovisual stimuli, representing variations of six contextual factors over three sessions in a one month period. For each stimulus, reactions were detected in the client's four peripheral autonomic nervous system signals using a rule-based classification algorithm. Results: During the presentation of audiovisual stimuli, the number of physiological reactions significantly differed from that observed in baseline (χ2=3.93, p=0.0476). Aural stimuli articulated in an unfamiliar voice, and aural stimuli containing anticipatory patterns were also physiologically arousing.

A case study was used to document intervention with a second-grade student who had developmental and severe expressive language delays. Based on the collaboration that was initiated between university and school corporation during the device acquisition process, it was determined that an interagency support system for this student would provide the best long-term solution for training, implementation, and maintenance related to her device. The participant's intervention progress before and after intervention was described using tests and video interactions. Interviews with the principal collaborators (two speech and language pathologists) and the parent were conducted post intervention. Findings revealed positive changes in performance on the receptive and expressive vocabulary testing and scores on communication functions used based on video analyses before and after intervention. Spontaneous device use at home and school was, however, limited. As the study represented one case, no further statistical analysis was conducted. Finally, some reflections on the process were provided by the two main interagency collaborators as well as the mother of the participant, and implications for future intervention were discussed. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2012.",AAC devices; AAC intervention; interagency collaboration,adolescent; adult; article; augmentative and alternative communication; case study; child; clinical article; communication skill; communication software; developmental disorder; disease severity; family; female; human; interpersonal communication; interview; language disability; linguistics; male; priority journal; school child; scoring system; social interaction; speech and language assessment; student; task performance; videorecording,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875945994,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,DynaVox Vmax,"IDD, BVI, Children",1

Research and development continues in the quest to improve the effectiveness of AAC systems in terms of communication rate and impact. One strategy involves making the basic unit of communication an entire utterance, and designing the AAC system to make the storage, retrieval and production of utterances as easy and efficient as possible. Some approaches take this further and include texts, narratives and/or multimedia material for use in conversation. AAC systems operating in such a manner require a structure for containing and managing conversational material and supporting the production of output during conversation. Ideally such a structure should be modelled on the way actual conversations proceed. A number of partial models for this have been presented thus far. These are reviewed in the paper and an integrated model is then proposed that includes both the structure of a conversation and the way in which an AAC system might produce conversational output (e.g. utterances, texts, multimedia items or combinations of these). Modelling the process in this way gives a structure with which an AAC system can organize the support and guidance that it offers to the person using the system. The paper concludes with consideration of three areas of development for further investigation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",AAC; Augmentative communication; Conversation; Modelling; Non-speaking; Scaffolding,AAC; Augmentative communication; Conversation; Non-speaking; Scaffolding; Human rehabilitation engineering; Models; Scaffolds; Communication,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879105407,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,n/a,AAC users,n/a

The causes vary but several tools and strategies can support their communication. These tools, which collectively fall under the banner of Assistive and Augmentative Communication (AAC), are rarely adaptive. Of those that are, few provide context-based or just-in-time vocabulary support to users even though the proliferation of smartphones makes this possible. To meet this need, we developed four algorithms to retrieve relevant vocabulary from Internet-based corpora. We used discourse completion tasks to evaluate each algorithm's ability to identify appropriate vocabulary across a set of specific contexts. The results indicate that our approach identifies appropriate context-specific words that complement general AAC vocabularies: when combined with a typical base vocabulary, the algorithms outperformed the support provided by the base vocabulary alone. They did this by adding small targeted vocabularies.

Such devices often rely on statistical language models to improve text entry by offering word predictions. These predictions can be improved if the language model is trained on data that closely reflects the style of the users' intended communications. Unfortunately, there is no large dataset consisting of genuine AAC messages. In this paper we demonstrate how we can crowd-source the creation of a large set of fictional AAC messages. We show that these messages model conversational AAC better than the currently used datasets based on telephone conversations or newswire text. We leverage our crowdsourced messages to intelligently select sentences from much larger sets of Twitter, blog and Usenet data. Compared to a model trained only on telephone transcripts, our best performing model reduced perplexity on three test sets of AAC-like communications by 60-82% relative.

The system allows its users to develop speech communication through images and sound on a desktop computer and download this speech to a mobile device that can then support communication outside the home. Using a desktop computer for input addresses some of this population's difficulties interacting with handheld devices, while the mobile device addresses stigma and portability issues. A modified participatory design approach was used in which proxies, that is, speech-language pathologists who work with aphasic individuals, assumed the role normally filled by users. This was done because of the difficulties in communicating with the target population and the high variability in aphasic disorders. In addition, the paper presents a case study of the proxy-use participatory design process that illustrates how different interview techniques resulted in different user feedback.

The methods of data collection were questionnaires, interviews and field notes.

Cet article examine certains problèmes qui contribuent au manque d'utilisation des systèmes de Communication Augmentative et Alternative (abréviation anglaise: AAC). Il présente les résultats de deux ans de recherches sur l'usage de l'AAC par 93 adolescents et adultes souffrant de paralysie cérébrale et par 186 de leurs partenaires en communication. La collecte des données s'est faite au moyen de questionnaires, les interviews et notes prises sur le terrain. Les résultats montrent que parmi les obstacles à un usage effectif des systèmes d'AAC on peut citer leur manque de disponibilité et d'accessibilité le manque de connaissance de l'AAC de la part des partenaires en communication, l'insuffisance de la thérapie, le type de vocabulaire des systèmes AAC et la présence d'autres modes de communication à la disposition de l'usager. In diesem Aufsatz werden einige Punkte erörtert, die zu mangelnden Einsatz unterstützender und alternativen Kommunikationssysteme (AAC = augmentative and alternative communication systems) beitragen.

Die Datenerhebungsmethoden bestanden aus Fragebögen, Gesprächer und Feldnotizen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, daß Hindernisse gegen der effektiven Einsatz von AAC-Systemen unter anderem darin bestehen, daß sie schwer erhältlich und schwer zugänglich sind, daß die Kommunikationspartner wenig darüber wissen, daß zu wenig Therapie geboten wird. Probleme entstehen auch durch das Vokabular, das in AAC-Systemen und anderen Kommunikationsmodi verwendet werden, die dem AAC-Benutzer zur Verfügung stehen. 1996 Royal College of Speech & Language Therapists.",Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC); Efficacy; Service delivery,adolescent; adult; article; cerebral palsy; communication disorder; human; major clinical study; Adolescent; Adult; Caregivers; Cerebral Palsy; Communication Aids for Disabled; Female; Humans; Male; Vocabulary,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052500031,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,n/a,Cerebral palsy,289

The conversational aid produced (via a voice synthesizer) speech acts that were selected from a prestored menu, which was constructed by the user. Features of the system included facilities for switching the conversational perspective between the speaker and listener (i.e., “your experiences and views” vs. “my experiences and views”), providing a range of comments on what the other speaker had said, effecting repair when there was a conversational breakdown, and following predicted sequences of speech acts. The initial trials of the system produced dialogues that proceeded in a natural way and achieved encouraging conversational rates. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.
